> [!NOTE]
> Profile card properties correspond to attributes in Microsoft Entra ID. Adding an attribute as a **profileCardProperty** to the **profileCardProperties** collection for an organization configures profile cards to display the attribute value. Deleting the **profileCardProperty** from the collection _doesnâ€™t delete the attribute from Microsoft Entra ID_; it deletes the configuration so that profile cards no longer display the attribute value.
