> [!NOTE]
> Some requests for Microsoft Entra resources require the use of advanced query capabilities. If you get a response indicating a bad request, unsupported query, or a response that includes unexpected results, including the `$count` query parameter and `ConsistencyLevel` header may allow the request to succeed. For details and examples, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](../concepts/aad-advanced-queries.md).
