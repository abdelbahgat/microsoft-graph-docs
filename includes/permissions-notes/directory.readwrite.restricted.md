Directory permissions provide the highest level of privilege for accessing directory resources such as [user](/graph/api/resources/user), [group](/graph/api/resources/group), and [device](/graph/api/resources/device) in an organization.

They also exclusively control access to other directory resources like: [organizational contacts](/graph/api/resources/orgcontact?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [schema extensions](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), as well as many directory resources including administrative units, directory roles, directory settings, and policies.
