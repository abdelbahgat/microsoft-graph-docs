The *CallRecord-PstnCalls.Read.All* permission grants an application access to [PSTN (calling plans)](/graph/api/callrecords-callrecord-getpstncalls) and direct routing call logs. This includes potentially sensitive information about users as well as calls to and from external phone numbers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Discretion should be used when granting these permissions to applications. Call records can provide insights into the operation of your business, and so can be a target for malicious actors. Only grant these permissions to applications you trust to meet your data protection requirements.
> - Make sure that you are compliant with the laws and regulations in your area regarding data protection and confidentiality of communications. Please see the [Terms of Use](/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use) and consult with your legal counsel for more information.
