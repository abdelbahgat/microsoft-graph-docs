# Get change notifications for presence updates in Microsoft Teams

Change notifications in Microsoft Graph enable you to subscribe to changes in [user presence](/microsoftteams/presence-admins) information in Microsoft Teams. Change notifications provide an alternative to polling for presence by using the [GET presence](/graph/api/presence-get) and [POST getPresencesByUserId](/graph/api/cloudcommunications-getpresencesbyuserid) APIs.

Use webhooks to subscribe to users' presence information and get notifications when changes occur. For general information on webhooks, see [Microsoft Graph API change notifications](/graph/api/resources/webhooks).

## Supported resources for presence

Subscriptions have a maximum expiration time of an hour. A subscription can be renewed via the [Update subscription API](/graph/api/subscription-update) before it expires, or a new subscription can be created for the same resource after expiration. Presence subscriptions support notifications with resource data, allowing more detailed information to be delivered along with change notifications. For more information, see [Set up change notifications with resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md).

The following table lists the types of presence changes you can subscribe to. For more information, see [Create subscription](/graph/api/subscription-post-subscriptions).

| Presence subscription type                    | Resource URL                                                   | Supported change types |
|:--------------------------------------------- |:-------------------------------------------------------------- |:---------------------- |
| Single user presence changes                  | `communications/presences/{id}`                                |Updated                |
| Bulk user presence changes (maximum 650 user IDs) | `communications/presences?$filter=id in ('{id}', '{id}', ...)` | Updated                |

### Subscribe to presence changes 

To subscribe to presence changes, you can set the resource in the subscription payload to `communications/presences/{id}` where the {id} field must be replaced with the user ID GUID of the user's presence. This subscription delivers change notifications when the user presence changes.

### Example: Single user presence subscription payloads

```json
{
    "changeType": "updated",
    "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "resource": "communications/presences/{id}",
    "expirationDateTime": "2023-09-14T10:00:00.0000000Z",
    "includeResourceData": true,
    "encryptionCertificate": "{encryption certificate}",
    "encryptionCertificateId": "{certificate id}",
    "clientState": "{secret client state}"
}
```

## Subscribe to multiple users' presence
Bulk subscriptions for user presence can be created by setting the subscription resource value to `/communications/presences?$filter=id in ('{id}', '{id}',...)`, where the {id} represents a user IDs GUID of users. A maximum of 650 users can be subscribed in a single subscription. Presence changes for user IDs generate a notification. 

### Example: Multiple user presence subscription payloads

```json
{
    "changeType": "updated",
    "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
    "resource": "/communications/presences?$filter=id in ('{id}', '{id}',...)",
    "expirationDateTime": "2023-09-14T10:00:00.0000000Z",
    "includeResourceData": true,
    "encryptionCertificate": "{encryption certificate}",
    "encryptionCertificateId": "{certificate id}",
    "clientState": "{secret client state}"
}
```

## Receive presence event notifications

Change notifications for presence events are triggered when changes to a user's availability and activity are made.

### Example: Basic presence notifications
```json
{
  "value": [{
    "subscriptionId": "{Subscription id}",
    "clientState": "{secret client state}",
    "changeType": "updated",
    "tenantId": "{Organization/Tenant id}",
    "resource": "communications/presences/{id}",
    "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2023-09-14T10:00:00.0000000Z",
    "resourceData": {
      "@odata.id": "users/{User Id}/presence",
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.presence",
      "id": "{User Id}"
    },
    "organizationId": "{Organization/Tenant id}",
  }]
}
```

### Example: Presence notifications with resource data 

Presence notifications with resource data have the following additional properties encrypted in the payload:
- Availability or base presence information (available, away, busy)
- Activity or information thatâ€™s supplemental to the availability (in a meeting, in call)

> [Note]:
> The availability and activity can be the same value.

For more information about possible combinations of availability and activity, see [Presence properties](/graph/api/resources/presence).

```json
{
  "value": [{
    "subscriptionId": "{Subscription id}",
    "clientState": "{secret client state}",
    "changeType": "updated",
    "tenantId": "{Organization/Tenant id}",
    "resource": "communications/presences/{id}",
    "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2023-09-14T10:00:00.0000000Z",
    "resourceData": {
      "@odata.id": "users/{User Id}/presence",
      "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.presence",
      "id": "{User Id}"
    },
    "organizationId": "{Organization/Tenant id}",
    "encryptedContent": {
      "data": "{Encrypted content}",
      "dataSignature": "{Encrypted data signature}",
      "dataKey": "{Encrypted data key for encrypting content}",
      "encryptionCertificateId": "{User specified id of encryption certificate}",
      "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "{Encrpytion certification thumbprint}"
    }
  }],
  "validationTokens": ["{Validation Tokens}"]
}
```

### Example: Decrypted notifications with resource data
```json
{
    "@odata.id": "users/{User Id}/presence",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.presence",
    "id": "{User Id}",
    "availability": "{Availability}",
    "activity": "{Activity}"
}
```
