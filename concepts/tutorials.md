# Microsoft Graph tutorials

Microsoft Graph tutorials are step-by-step training exercises that guide you through creating a basic application that accesses data via Microsoft Graph. They are designed to be completed within 30 minutes.

## Delegated (user) authentication

In the delegated authentication tutorials, you create a basic command-line application that has the following features:

- Enables user authentication to [get access on behalf of a user](auth-v2-user.md)
- Accesses the user's profile
- Lists the user's mailbox
- Sends an email from the user's mailbox

If you prefer to download a completed project, you can do so from one of the following locations:

- **The project's corresponding GitHub repository**. Instructions for registering an application and configuring the sample are located in each repository.
- **A [Microsoft Graph quick start](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/quick-start)**. A quick start automates registering an application for you and downloads the completed project already configured for user authentication. A quick start is available for all tutorials except Power Automate.

## App-only authentication

In the app-only authentication tutorials, you create a basic command-line application that has the following features:

- Enables app-only authentication to [get access without a user](auth-v2-service.md)
- Lists users in Microsoft Entra ID

If you prefer to download a completed project, you can do so from the project's corresponding GitHub repository. Instructions for registering an application and configuring the sample are located in each repository.
