# Set up notifications for changes in resource data

Change notifications enable applications to receive alerts when a Microsoft Graph resource they're interested in changes; that is, created, updated, or deleted. Microsoft Graph sends notifications to the specified client endpoint, and the client service processes the notifications according to the business requirements. For example, the service may fetch more data, update its cache and views, and so on.

## Why get change notifications?

Change notifications follow an event-driven model where customers receive alerts when changes occur instead of them polling Microsoft Graph. Depending on your business logic, change notifications are suitable when:

- You're subscribing to a resource that changes frequently.
- You need to react to changes in near real-time.
- You want to avoid frequently polling Microsoft Graph which might cause you to hit the throttling limits.

## Types of change notifications

Microsoft Graph supports three types of change notifications:

- **Basic notifications**: Change notifications that don't contain resource data other than the **id** of the resource that changed. All Microsoft Graph resources support basic notifications. When an app receives a basic notification, the service can use the **id** to query to changed object.
- **Rich notifications**: Change notifications that include the resource data of the object that changed. For the list of Microsoft Graph resources that support rich notifications, see [supported resources](#supported-resources).
- **Lifecycle notifications**: Notifications that alert the customer when they are at risk of missing change notifications due to the lifecycle of their subscription. For more information about lifecycle notifications, see [Lifecycle notifications](./webhooks-lifecycle.md).

## Supported resources

## Receiving change notifications

Microsoft Graph can deliver change notifications to clients via the following channels.

- **Webhooks**. For more information, see [Receive change notifications through webhooks](./change-notifications-delivery-webhooks.md).
- **Azure Event Hubs**. For more information, see [Receive change notifications through Azure Event Hubs](./change-notifications-delivery-event-hubs.md).
- **Azure Event Grid** (preview). For more information, see [Receive change notifications through Azure Event Grid](/azure/event-grid/subscribe-to-graph-api-events?context=graph%2Fcontext).

## Subscription lifetime

Subscriptions have a limited lifetime. Apps need to renew their subscriptions before the expiration time; Otherwise, they need to create a new subscription. Apps can also unsubscribe at any time to stop getting change notifications.

The following table shows the maximum expiration times for subscriptions per resource in Microsoft Graph.

## Managing subscriptions

Clients can create subscriptions, renew subscriptions, and delete subscriptions. Then while the subscription is valid and when changes occur in the subscribed resource, Microsoft Graph sends change notifications to the specified notification endpoint.

You manage the subscription using the [subscription resource type](/graph/api/resources/subscription) and its related methods. While the subscription is valid and changes occur in the subscribed resource, Microsoft Graph sends a change notification in a structure defined in the [changeNotificationCollection resource type](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection).

For more information about managing subscriptions for the different delivery channels using Microsoft Graph, see the following articles.

- [Receive change notifications through webhooks](./change-notifications-delivery-webhooks.md).
- [Receive change notifications through Azure Event Hubs](./change-notifications-delivery-event-hubs.md).
