# Tutorial: Manage access to resources in Active Directory entitlement management using Microsoft Graph APIs

Managing access to all the resources that employees need, such as groups, applications, and sites, is an important function for organizations. You want to grant employees the right level of access they need to be productive and remove their access when it is no longer needed. [Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview) using Microsoft Graph APIs enables you to manage this type of access.

In this tutorial, you learn how to develop code to create a package of resources for a marketing campaign that internal users can self-service request. Requests do not require approval and user's access expires after 30 days. For this tutorial, the marketing campaign resources are just membership in a single group, but it could be a collection of groups, applications, or SharePoint Online sites.

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this tutorial, make sure that you have the required prerequisites:
- Azure AD entitlement management requires specific licenses. For more information, see [License requirements](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview#license-requirements). The following licenses are required in your tenant:
    - Azure AD Premium P2
    - Enterprise Mobility + Security (EMS) E5 license
- This tutorial assumes that you are using Microsoft Graph Explorer, but you can use Postman, or create your own client app to call Microsoft Graph. To call the Microsoft Graph APIs in this tutorial, you need to use an account with the global administrator role and the appropriate permissions. For this tutorial, the `User.ReadWrite.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All`, and `EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All` delegated permissions are needed. Complete the following steps to set permissions in Microsoft Graph Explorer:
    1. Start [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer).
    2. Select **Sign-In with Microsoft** and sign in using an Azure AD global administrator account. After you successfully sign in, you can see the user account details in the left-hand pane.
    3. Select the settings icon to the right of the user account details, and then select **Select permissions**.

        ![Select the Microsoft Graph permissions](./images/tutorial-access-package-api/set-permissions.png)
        
    4. Scroll through the list of permissions to the `Group` permissions, expand **Group (2)**, select the **Group.ReadWrite.All** permission. Scroll further down the list of permissions to the `User` permissions, expand **User (8)**, and select the **User.ReadWrite.All** permission.

        ![Search for the user, group, and entitlementmanagement permissions](./images/tutorial-access-package-api/set-user-permission.png)
    
    5. Select **Consent**, and then select **Accept** to accept the consent of the permissions. You do not need to consent on behalf of your organization for these permissions.
    6. Search for the `EntitlementManagement` permissions, expand **EntitlementManagement (2)**, select the **Entitlement.ReadWrite.All** permission, and then select **Consent**. Because this permission requires admin consent and is needed by a user account that you create in this tutorial, you must select **Consent on behalf of your organization**.

        ![Consent for organization](./images/tutorial-access-package-api/consent-for-organization.png)

    7. Select **Accept** to accept the consent of the permissions.

## Step 1: Create a user account and a group

In this step, you create a group named **Marketing resources** in the directory that is the target resource for entitlement management. You also create a user account that is set up as an internal requestor.

### Create a user account

For this tutorial, you create a user account that is used to request access to the resources in the access package. When you make these calls, change `contoso.onmicrosoft.com` to the domain name of your tenant. You can find tenant information on the Azure Active Directory overview page. Record the value of the **id** property that is returned to be used later in the tutorial.

#### Request

``` http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users
Content-type: application/json

{
  "accountEnabled":true,
  "displayName":"Requestor1",
  "mailNickname":"Requestor1",
  "userPrincipalName":"Requestor1@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
  "passwordProfile": {
    "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn":true,
    "password":"Contoso1234"
  }
}
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity",
  "id": "007d1c7e-7fa8-4e33-b678-5e437acdcddc",
  "deletedDateTime": null,
  "accountEnabled": true,
  "ageGroup": null,
  "businessPhones": [],
  "city": null,
  "createdDateTime": null,
  "creationType": null,
  "companyName": null,
  "consentProvidedForMinor": null,
  "country": null,
  "department": null,
  "displayName": "Requestor1",
  "employeeId": null,
  "faxNumber": null,
  "givenName": null,
  "imAddresses": [],
  "infoCatalogs": [],
  "isResourceAccount": null,
  "jobTitle": null,
  "legalAgeGroupClassification": null,
  "mail": null,
  "mailNickname": "Requestor1",
}
```

### Create a group

In this tutorial, you create a group named **Marketing resources** that is the target resource for entitlement management. You can use an existing group if you already have one. Record the value of the **id** property that is returned to use later in this tutorial. 

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups
Content-type: application/json

{
  "description":"Marketing group",
  "displayName":"Marketing resources",
  "mailEnabled":false,
  "mailNickname":"markres",
  "securityEnabled":true
}
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups/$entity",
  "id": "e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
  "deletedDateTime": null,
  "classification": null,
  "createdDateTime": "2020-06-24T16:47:37Z",
  "createdByAppId": "de8bc8b5-d9f9-48b1-a8ad-b748da725064",
  "description": "Marketing group",
  "displayName": "Marketing resources",
  "expirationDateTime": null,
  "groupTypes": [],
  "infoCatalogs": [],
  "isAssignableToRole": null,
  "mail": null,
  "mailEnabled": false,
  "mailNickname": "markres"
}
```

## Step 2: Add resources to a catalog and create an access package

An *access package* is a bundle of resources that a team or project needs and is governed with policies. Access packages are defined in containers called catalogs. Catalogs can reference resources, such as groups, apps and sites, that are used in the access package. In this step, you create a **Marketing Campaign** access package in the General catalog. If you have a different catalog, use its name in the next section.

### Get the catalog identifier

To add resources to the catalog, you must first get the identifier of it. If you are using the General catalog, run the following request to get its identifier. If you are using a different calalog, change the filter value in the request to the name of your catalog. Record the value of the **id** property that is returned to use later in this tutorial.

#### Request

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageCatalogs?$filter=(displayName eq 'General')
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#accessPackageCatalogs",
  "value": [ 
    {
      "id": "cec5d6ab-c75d-47c0-9c1c-92e89f66e384",
      "displayName": "General",
      "description": "Built-in catalog.",
      "catalogType": "ServiceDefault",
      "catalogStatus": "Published",
      "isExternallyVisible": true,
      "createdBy": "Azure AD",
      "createdDateTime": "2020-05-30T10:58:05.363Z",
      "modifiedBy": "Azure AD",
      "modifiedDateTime": "2020-05-30T10:58:05.363Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

The response should only contain the catalog whose name you provided in the request. If there are no values returned, check that the name of the catalog is correct before you proceed.

### Add the group to the catalog

To add the group that you created to the catalog, provide the following property values:
- **catalogId** - the **id** of the catalog that you are using
- **displayName** - the name of the group
- **description** - the description of the group
- **originId** - the **id** of the group that you created

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageResourceRequests
Content-type: application/json

{
  "catalogId":"cec5d6ab-c75d-47c0-9c1c-92e89f66e384",
  "requestType": "AdminAdd",
  "justification": "",
  "accessPackageResource": {
    "displayName": "Marketing resources",
    "description": "Marketing group",
    "resourceType": "AadGroup",
    "originId": "e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
    "originSystem": "AadGroup"
  }
}
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageResourceRequests/$entity",
  "catalogId": "cec5d6ab-c75d-47c0-9c1c-92e89f66e384",
  "executeImmediately": false,
  "id": "44e521e0-fb6b-4d5e-a282-e7e68dc59493",
  "requestType": "AdminAdd",
  "requestState": "Delivered",
  "requestStatus": "Fulfilled",
  "isValidationOnly": false,
  "expirationDateTime": null,
  "justification": ""
}
```

### Get catalog resources

In later steps in this tutorial, you need the **id** that was assigned to the group resource in the catalog. This identifier, which represents the group as a resource in the catalog, is different than the identifier of the group itself in Microsoft Graph. This is because a catalog can have resources which aren't represented in Microsoft Graph.

In the request, provide the **id** of the catalog that you are using. Record the value of the **id** property for the group catalog resource.

#### Request

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageCatalogs/cec5d6ab-c75d-47c0-9c1c-92e89f66e384/accessPackageResources?$filter=(displayName eq 'Marketing resources')
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#accessPackageResources",
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "4a1e21c5-8a76-4578-acb1-641160e076e8",
      "displayName": "Marketing resources",
      "description": "Marketing group",
      "url": "https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r?tenantId=d3030981-8fb9-4919-9980-5580caeddd75#/manageMembership?objectType=Group&objectId=e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
      "resourceType": "Security Group",

      "addedBy": "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
      "addedOn": "2020-08-21T19:27:29.967Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Get resources roles

The access package assigns users to the roles of a resource. The typical role of a group is the member role. Other resources, such as SharePoint Online sites and applications, might have many roles. The typical role of a group used in an access package is the member role. You'll need the member role when you add a resource role to the access package later in this tutorial. 

In the request, use the **id** of the catalog and the **id** of the group resource in the catalog that you recorded to get the **originId** of the Member resource role. Record the value of the **originId** property to use later in this tutorial.

#### Request

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageCatalogs/cec5d6ab-c75d-47c0-9c1c-92e89f66e384/accessPackageResourceRoles?$filter=(originSystem+eq+%27AadGroup%27+and+accessPackageResource/id+eq+%274a1e21c5-8a76-4578-acb1-641160e076e8%27+and+displayName+eq+%27Member%27)&$expand=accessPackageResource
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageCatalogs('ede67938-cda7-4127-a9ca-7c7bf86a19b7')/accessPackageResourceRoles(accessPackageResource())",
  "value": [
    {
      "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "displayName": "Member",
      "description": null,
      "originSystem": "AadGroup",
      "originId": "Member_e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
      "accessPackageResource": {
        "id": "4a1e21c5-8a76-4578-acb1-641160e076e8",
        "displayName": "Marketing resources",
        "description": "Marketing group",
        "url": "https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/r?tenantId=d3030981-8fb9-4919-9980-5580caeddd75#/manageMembership?objectType=Group&objectId=e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
        "resourceType": "Security Group",
        "originId": "e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
        "originSystem": "AadGroup",
        "isPendingOnboarding": false,
        "addedBy": "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
        "addedOn": "2020-06-26T17:13:23.723Z",
        "accessPackageResourceScopes": []
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If successful, a single value is returned, which represents the Member role of that group. If no roles are returned, check the **id** values of the catalog and the access package resource.

### Create the access package

At this point, you have a catalog with a group resource, and you know that you'll use the resource role of group member in the access package. The next step is to create the access package. After you have the access package, you can add the resource role to it, and create a policy for how users can request access to that resource role. You use the **id** of the catalog that you recorded earlier to create the access package. Record the **id** of the access package to use later in this tutorial.

#### Request

  "modifiedBy": "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
  "modifiedDateTime": "2020-08-21T19:45:33.2042281Z"
}
```

### Add a resource role to the access package

Add the Member role of the group resource to the access package. In the request, provide the **id** of the access package. In the request body provide the **id** of the group catalog resource for accessPackageResource, and provide the **originId** of the Member role that you previously recorded.

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages/88203d16-0e31-41d4-87b2-dd402f1435e9/accessPackageResourceRoleScopes
Content-type: application/json

{
  "accessPackageResourceRole": {
    "originId":"Member_e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487",
    "displayName":"Member",
    "originSystem":"AadGroup",
    "accessPackageResource": {
      "id":"4a1e21c5-8a76-4578-acb1-641160e076e8","resourceType":"Security Group",  
      "originId":"e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487","originSystem":"AadGroup"
    }
  },
  "accessPackageResourceScope": {
    "originId":"e93e24d1-2b65-4a6c-a1dd-654a12225487","originSystem":"AadGroup"
  }
}
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackages('88203d16-0e31-41d4-87b2-dd402f1435e9')/accessPackageResourceRoleScopes/$entity",
  "id": "e081321b-2802-4834-a6ca-6f598ce3cdf7_6dbd2209-9d14-4c76-b92b-fcb00e835fe1",

  "modifiedBy": "admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
  "modifiedDateTime": "2020-08-21T19:56:00.6320729Z"
}
```

The access package now has one resource role, which is group membership. The role is assigned to any user who has the access package.

### Create an access package policy

Now that you created the access package and added resources and roles, you can decide who can access it by creating an access package policy. In this tutorial, you enable the **Requestor1** account that you created to request access to the resources in the access package. For this task, you need these values:
- **id** of the access package for the value of the **accessPackageId** property
- **id** of the **Requestor1** user account for the value of the **id** property in **allowedRequestors**
 
The value of the **durationInDays** property enables the **Requestor1** account to access the resources in the access package for up to 30 days. Record the value of the **id** property that is returned to use later in this tutorial. 

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentPolicies
Content-type: application/json

{
  "accessPackageId": "88203d16-0e31-41d4-87b2-dd402f1435e9",

    "isApprovalRequiredForExtension": false,
    "isRequestorJustificationRequired": false,
    "approvalMode": "NoApproval",
    "approvalStages": []
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Request access

In this step, the **Requestor1** user account requests access to the resources in the access package.

To request access to resources in the access package, you need to provide these values:
- **id** of the **Requestor1** user account that you created for the value of the **targetId** property
- **id** of the assignment policy for the value of the **assignmentPolicyId** property
- **id** of the access package for the value of **accessPackageId** property

In the response you can see the status of **Accepted** and a state of **Submitted**. Record the value of the **id** property that is returned to get the status of the request later.

If you haven't done so already, sign out of the administrator account that you were using in Microsoft Graph Explorer. Sign in to the **Requestor1** user account that you created. You will be asked to change the password if it is the first time you are signing in.

#### Request

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
Content-type: application/json

{
  "requestType": "UserAdd",
  "accessPackageAssignment":{
     "targetId":"007d1c7e-7fa8-4e33-b678-5e437acdcddc",
     "assignmentPolicyId":"db440482-1210-4a60-9b55-3ac7a72f63ba",
     "accessPackageId":"88203d16-0e31-41d4-87b2-dd402f1435e9"
  }
}
```

#### Response

```http
{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#accessPackageAssignmentRequests/$entity",
    "createdDateTime": null,
    "completedDate": null,
    "id": "a6bb6942-3ae1-4259-9908-0133aaee9377",
    "requestType": "UserAdd",
    "requestState": "Submitted",
    "requestStatus": "Accepted",
    "isValidationOnly": false,
    "expirationDateTime": null,
    "justification": null
}
```

## Step 4: Validate that access has been assigned

In this step, you confirm that the **Requestor1** user account was assigned the access package and that they are now a member of the **Marketing resources** group.

Sign out of the Requestor1 account and sign back in to the administrator account to see the status of the request.

### Get the status of the request

Use the value of the **id** property of the request to get the current status of it. In the response, you can see the status changed to **Fulfilled** and the state changed to **Delivered**.

#### Request

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests/a6bb6942-3ae1-4259-9908-0133aaee9377

  "requestState": "Delivered",
  "requestStatus": "FulfilledNotificationTriggered",
  "isValidationOnly": false,
  "expirationDateTime": null,
  "justification": null
}
```

### Get access package assignments

You can also use the **id** of the access package policy that you created to see that resources have been assigned to the **Requestor1** user account.

#### Request

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignments?$filter=accessPackageAssignmentPolicy/Id eq 'db440482-1210-4a60-9b55-3ac7a72f63ba'&$expand=target,accessPackageAssignmentResourceRoles
