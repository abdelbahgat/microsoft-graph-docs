# Send activity feed notifications to users in Microsoft Teams

The Microsoft Teams activity feed enables users to triage items that require attention by notifying them of changes. You can use the activity feed notification APIs in Microsoft Graph to extend this functionality to your apps. It also allows your apps to provide richer experiences and better engage users by helping to keep them up to date with changes in the tools and workflows they use.

## Understand the basics of activity feed notification

The following image shows that activity feed notifications in Microsoft Teams comprise multiple bits of information displayed together.

![Image showing components of an activity feed notification](images/teams-activityfeednotifications/notificationtemplate.png)

The components include:
- The actor who initiated the activity
- An icon that represents the activity type
- The reason the actor did the activity
- A text preview
- A timestamp
- The location of the activity

The following example shows how these components provide the details about a notification. This example is a notification about a user mentioned in a Yammer community.

## Requirements for using the activity feed notification APIs

Activity feed APIs work with a [Teams app](/microsoftteams/platform/overview). The following are the requirements for sending activity feed notifications:

- The Teams app manifest must have the Microsoft Entra app ID added to the `webApplicationInfo` section. For more information, see [manifest schema](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).
- Activity notifications can be sent with or without activity types declared in the app manifest.
  - By default, you can use the activity notification APIs without declaring the `activities` section in the manifest. The `systemDefault` activity type is reserved, allowing you to provide free-form text in the `Actor+Reason` line of the activity feed notification.  For more information, see [Send customizable activity feed notifications](#example-8-send-a-notification-to-a-user-using-the-systemdefault-activity-type).
  - If you want to send a templated notification in the traditional mode, activity types must be declared in the [Activities](#activities-section-changes) section. For more information, see [Manifest schema](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).
- The Teams app must be installed for the recipient, either personally or in a [team](/graph/api/resources/team) or [chat](/graph/api/resources/chat) they're part of. For more information, see [Teams app installation](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation).

### Permissions

You can use delegated or application permissions to send activity notifications. When you use application permissions, we recommend that you use [resource-specific consent (RSC)](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent) because the `TeamsActivity.Send.User` permission allows the user to consent to send activity notifications. You must declare RSC permissions in your Teams app [manifest schema](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).

### Teams app manifest changes

This section describes the changes that must be added to the Teams app manifest. You need to use the [Teams app manifest](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) version `1.7` or greater.

```json
"$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.7/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
"manifestVersion": "1.7",
```

#### webApplicationInfo section changes

```json
"webApplicationInfo":
{
    "id": "a3111f15-658e-457c-9689-fd20fe907330",
    "resource": "https://contosoapp.com"
}
```

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|string|Microsoft Entra (client ID).|
|resource|string|Resource associated with the Azure AD app. It is also known as a reply or redirect URI in the Microsoft Entra admin center app registration overview.|

> [!NOTE]
> You might get an error if multiple Teams apps in the same scope (team, chat, or user) use the same Microsoft Entra app. Make sure that you're using unique Microsoft Entra apps.

#### activities section changes

```json
"activities":
{
  "activityTypes": [
    {
      "type": "taskCreated",
      "description": "Task Created Activity",
      "templateText": "{actor} created task {taskId} for you"
    },
    {
      "type": "approvalRequired",
      "description": "Deployment requires your approval",
      "templateText": "{actor} created a new deployment {deploymentId}"
    }
  ]
}
```

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|type|string|The type needs to be unique in a specific manifest.|
|description|string|Human-readable short description. The description is visible on the Microsoft Teams client.|
|templateText|string|Template text for the activity notification. You can declare your parameters by encapsulating parameters in `{}`.|

> [!NOTE]
> * `actor` is a special parameter that always takes the caller's name. In delegated calls, `actor` is the user's name. In application-only calls, it takes the name of the Teams app.
>
> * The reserved `systemDefault` activity type should not be provided in the `activities` section of the manifest. The reserved activity type can provide free-form text in the `Actor+Reason` line of the activity feed notification. For more information, see [Send customizable activity feed notifications](#example-8-send-a-notification-to-a-user-using-the-systemdefault-activity-type).

#### authorization section changes

```json
"authorization": 
{ 
  "permissions": { 
    "resourceSpecific": [ 
      {
        "type": "Application", 
         "name": "TeamsActivity.Send.User" 
      }, 
      { 
        "type": "Application",
        "name": "TeamsActivity.Send.Group"
      }, 
      { 
        "type": "Application", 
        "name": "TeamsActivity.Send.Chat" 
      } 
    ] 
  }
} 

```

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|type|string|The resource-specific consent (RSC) permission type.|
|name|string|The name of the RSC permission. For more information, see [Supported RSC permissions](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent#supported-rsc-permissions) |

### Install the Teams app

Teams apps can be installed in a team, a chat, or for a user personally, and can be distributed in multiple ways. For details, see [Teams app distribution methods](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/overview). Typically, [sideloading](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload) is preferred for development purposes. After development, you can choose the right distribution method based on whether you want to distribute to one tenant or all tenants.

You can also use [Teams app installation](/graph/api/resources/teamsappinstallation) APIs to manage Teams app installations.

## Send activity feed notifications to users

> [!NOTE]
> The app must be included in the allow list to show activity feed notifications on iOS and Android clients. Only third-party apps are supported.

Because a Teams app can be installed for a user, in a team, or a chat, the notifications can be sent in these three contexts as well:

- [Send notification to user in a chat](/graph/api/chat-sendactivitynotification)
- [Send notification to user in a team](/graph/api/team-sendactivitynotification)
- [Send notification to user](/graph/api/userteamwork-sendactivitynotification)

Additionally, notifications can be sent in bulk up to 100 users at a time:

* [Send notifications to multiple users in bulk](/graph/api/teamwork-sendactivitynotificationtorecipients)

For details about what topics are supported for each scenario, see the specific APIs. Custom text-based topics are supported for all scenarios.

> [!NOTE]
> The activity icon is based on the context in which the request is made. If the request is made with delegated permissions, the user's photo appears as the avatar, while the Teams app icon appears as the activity icon. In an application-only context, the Teams app icon is used as the avatar, and the activity icon is omitted.

### Example 1: Notify a user about a task created in a chat

This example shows how you can send an activity feed notification for a new task created in a chat. In this case, the Teams app must be installed in a chat with Id `chatId` and user `569363e2-4e49-4661-87f2-16f245c5d66a` must also be part of the chat.

### Example 3: Notify a user about an event using a custom topic

As the previous examples show, you can link to different team or chat aspects. However, if you want to link to an aspect that is not part of the team or Microsoft Graph doesn't represent it, or if you want to customize the name, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. Additionally, `webUrl` is required when you use `topic` source as `text`.

The Yammer notification example shown earlier uses a custom topic because Microsoft Graph does not support Yammer's resources.

> [!NOTE]
> `webUrl` must start with the Microsoft Teams domain (teams.microsoft.com, for example).

### Example 8: Send a notification to a user using the systemDefault activity type
This example shows how you can send an activity notification for a team without activity types defined in the manifest. You have the flexibility to provide free-form text here. For more information, see [Reserved activity types](#reserved-activity-types).

This example notifies the team owner to take a short break. Modify the `value` in `templateParameters` to customize the notification for various scenarios.

## Reserved activity types

- The `systemDefault` activity type is reserved and can't be used in the manifest while declaring [Activities](#activities-section-changes).
- You can use the `systemDefault` activity type to:
  - Easily test new scenarios and/or quickly try the activity feed notification APIs without defining activity types in your app's manifest.
  - For Store apps, it saves time and streamlines the process because you don't need to constantly adjust activity types in your app's manifest. The `systemDefault` activity type is ready to use from the get-go.
- Keep in mind that with the `systemDefault` activity type, you can't:
  - Utilize the built-in localization features provided by manifests.
  - Rely on sending customizable notifications with the  `systemDefault` activity type. Users can turn off all notifications from your app with a toggle in the Microsoft Teams client settings, which can hinder communication between your app and its users.
- We still recommend templated notifications for recurring and large batches of notifications because they require activity templates in the manifest.
- The `systemDefault` reserved activity type remains available, regardless of the activity types listed in your app's manifest.

## Customize how the notifications alert you

Microsoft Teams users can customize the notifications they see in their feed, as a banner, and so on. Notifications generated through activity feed APIs can also be customized. Users can choose how they're notified via settings in Microsoft Teams. Teams apps appear in the list for the user to choose from, as shown in the following screenshot.

![Screenshot of the Notifications settings in Teams, with the Custom option highlighted](images/teams-activityfeednotifications/notificationsettings.png)

Users can click **Edit** next to an app and customize the notifications, as shown in the following example. The `description` field in the Teams app manifest is displayed.

## FAQs

### Who needs to install the Teams app?

The target user must have the Teams app that is sending notifications installed.

### Can a user send notifications to themselves?
``

No, a user can't send notifications to themselves. For this scenario, use application permissions.

### Can a Teams app control how the notifications are shown to the user?

No, only users are allowed to change notification settings.

### I installed my app; why don't I see notification settings under the user account?

The settings appear after the Teams app sends the first notification. This reduces the number of settings that users see.

### I started getting a 409 (conflict) error; how do I resolve it?

`Conflict` errors primarily occur when multiple Teams apps installed in the same scope (team, chat, user, and so on) have the same Microsoft Entra appId in the `webApplicationInfo` section of the manifest. When this happens, you get an error like `Found multiple applications with the same Microsoft Entra App ID 'Your Microsoft Entra AppId'.`. Make sure that you use unique Microsoft Entra apps for unique Teams apps.  You can install the same Teams app in multiple scopes (team + user, for example).
