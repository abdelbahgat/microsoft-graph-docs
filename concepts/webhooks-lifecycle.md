# Reduce missing subscriptions and change notifications

Apps subscribing to change notifications might get their subscriptions removed and miss some change notifications. Apps should implement logic to detect and recover from the loss, and resume a continuous change notification flow.

Certain events can cause a subscription to be removed. These events include:

- User's password has been reset
- User's device is out of compliance
-	User's account has been revoked

When such an event happens, Microsoft Graph sends a special lifecycle notification, `subscriptionRemoved`.

Microsoft Graph also sends another lifecycle notification, `missed`, if a change notification cannot be delivered to an app.

An app subscribing to change notifications should listen to the `subscriptionRemoved` and `missed` signals and do the following:

- Upon receiving a `subscriptionRemoved` lifecycle notification, the app should recreate the subscription in order to maintain a continuous flow.
- On receiving a `missed` lifecycle notification, the app should resynchronize resource data using Microsoft Graph.

To receive lifecycle notifications, you can use the existing **notificationUrl** endpoint that already receives change notifications, or you can register a separate **lifecycleNotificationUrl** to receive `subscriptionRemoved` and `missed` lifecycle notifications in a separate endpoint.

Lifecycle notifications are supported for subscriptions created on these resource types:

- Outlook [message][]
- Outlook [event][]
- Outlook personal [contact][]
- Teams [chatMessage][]

For other resource types, you may still provide a `lifecycleNotificationUrl` when creating the subscription and your application will receive lifecycle notifications whenever the resource implements it.

## Creating a subscription

When creating a subscription, you must specify a separate notification endpoint using the **lifecycleNotificationUrl** property. If you specify the endpoint, all current and future types of lifecycle notifications will be delivered there. Otherwise, `subscriptionRemoved` and `missed` lifecycle notifications will not be delivered. This endpoint can be the same as the **notificationUrl**.

### Subscription request example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/lifecycleNotifications",
  "resource": "/users/{id}/messages",
  "expirationDateTime": "2020-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "<secretClientState>"
}
```
 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the same hostname (FQDN) for both notifications URLs. 

You need to validate both endpoints, as described in [Managing subscriptions](webhooks.md#managing-subscriptions). If you choose to use the same URL for both endpoints, you will receive and respond to two validation requests.

> **Note:** You cannot update (`PATCH`) the existing subscriptions to add the **lifecycleNotificationUrl** property. You should remove such existing subscriptions, create new subscriptions, and specify the **lifecycleNotificationUrl** property. Existing subscriptions without a **lifecycleNotificationUrl** property will not receive the `subscriptionRemoved` and `missed` notifications.

## Responding to subscriptionRemoved notifications

The `subscriptionRemoved` lifecycle notification informs you that a subscription has been removed and should be recreated, if you want to continue receiving change notifications. 

You can create a long-lived subscription (3 days), and change notifications will start flowing to the **notificationUrl**. However, the conditions of access to the resource data might change over time. For example, an event in the service might occur that requires the app to re-authenticate the user. In such a case, the flow is as follows:

1. The service detects that a subscription needs to be removed from Microsoft Graph.
    
    There is no set cadence for these events. They might occur frequently for some resources, and almost never for others.

2. Microsoft Graph sends a `subscriptionRemoved` lifecycle notification to the **lifecycleNotificationUrl** (if specified).  

3. You can respond to this lifecycle notification by creating a new subscription for the same resource. To do this, you need to present a valid access token; in some cases, this means the app needs to re-authenticate the user to obtain a new valid access token.

4. If you successfully create a new subscription, change notifications will start flowing again. However, if you fail (for example, the app can't obtain a valid access token), change notifications will not be sent.

5. After creating the new subscription, you can sync the resource data to identify any missing changes.

### subscriptionRemoved notification example

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "subscriptionId":"<subscription_guid>",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime":"2019-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
      "tenantId": "<tenant_guid>",
      "clientState":"<secretClientState>",
      "lifecycleEvent": "subscriptionRemoved"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few things to note about this type of notification:

- The `"lifecycleEvent": "subscriptionRemoved"` field designates this notification as related to subscription removal. Other types of lifecycle notifications are also possible, and new ones will be introduced in the future.
- The lifecycle notification does not contain any information about a specific resource, because it is not related to a resource change, but to the subscription state change.
- Similar to change notifications, lifecycle notifications can be batched together (in the **value** array), each with a possibly different **lifecycleEvent** value. Process each lifecycle notification in the batch accordingly.

> **Note:** for a full description of the data sent when change notifications are delivered, see [changeNotificationCollection](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection).

### Actions to take

1. [Acknowledge](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the receipt of the lifecycle notification, by responding to the POST call with `202 - Accepted`.
2. [Validate](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the authenticity of the lifecycle notification.
3. Ensure that the app has a valid access token to take the next step. 
  > **Note:** If you're using one of the [authentication libraries](/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries), they will handle this for you by either reusing a valid cached token, or obtaining a new token, including asking the user to sign in again (with a new password). Note that obtaining a new token might fail, because the conditions of access might have changed, and the caller might no longer be allowed access to the resource data.

4. Create a new subscription using the standard process described [here](webhooks.md#subscription-request-example).

  > **Note:** This action might fail, because the authorization checks performed by the system might deny the app or the user access to the resource. It might be necessary for the app to obtain a new access token from the user to successfully reauthorize a subscription. You can retry these actions later, at any time; for example, when the conditions of access have changed. Any resource changes in the time period from when the lifecycle notification was sent, to when the app recreates the subscription successfully, will be lost. The app will need to fetch those changes on its own.

5. After creating the new subscription, sync any missing resource data from the last known time you received a change notification for this resource; for example: `GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/messages?$filter=createdDateTime+ge+{LastTimeNotificationWasReceived}`

## Responding to missed notifications

These signals inform you that some change notifications might not have been delivered. You should decide if you ignore or handle these signals.

### Notification example

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "subscriptionId":"<subscription_guid>",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime":"2019-03-20T11:00:00.0000000Z",
      "tenantId": "<tenant_guid>",
      "clientState":"<secretClientState>",
      "lifecycleEvent": "missed"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few things to note about this type of notification:

- The `"lifecycleEvent": "missed"` field designates this as a signal about missed change notifications. Other types of lifecycle notifications are also possible, and new ones will be introduced in the future.
- The lifecycle notification does not contain any information about a specific resource, because it is not related to a resource change, but to the subscription state change.
- Similar to change notifications, lifecycle notifications might be batched together (in the **value** array), each with a possibly different **lifecycleEvent** value. Process each lifecycle notification in the batch accordingly.

> **Note:** for a full description of the data sent when change notifications are delivered, see [changeNotificationCollection](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection).

### Actions to take

1. [Acknowledge](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the receipt of the lifecycle notification, by responding to the POST call with `202 - Accepted`.
    - If you ignore these signals, do nothing else. Otherwise:
2. [Validate](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the authenticity of the lifecycle notification.
3. Perform a full data resync of the resource to identify the changes that were not delivered as notifications. 

## Responding to reauthorizationRequired notifications

When you receive a `reauthorizationRequired` lifecycle notification, you must reauthorize the subscription to maintain the data flow.

You can create a long-lived subscription depending on the [maximum supported subscription lifetime for the resource](/graph/api/resources/subscription#maximum-length-of-subscription-per-resource-type), which enables change notifications to flow to the **notificationUrl**. If the conditions of access changed after the subscription was created, or Microsoft Graph detects that the notification flow might be interrupted in the near future, Microsoft Graph may require that you reauthorize the subscription to prove that you still have access to the resource's data. The following are examples of conditions that may affect your access to data:

- A tenant administrator may revoke your app's permissions to read a resource.
- In an interactive scenario, the user who provides the authentication token to your app may be subject to dynamic policies based on various factors, such as their location, device state, or risk assessment. For example, if the user changes their physical location, the user may no longer be allowed to access the data, and your app will not be able to reauthorize the subscription. For more information about dynamic policies that control access, see [Azure AD conditional access policies](/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview). 
- Your access token expires. This only applies to notifications that include resource data.
- The subscription expires before you renew it.

Before any of these conditions become true, Microsoft Graph will send an authorization challenge to the **lifecycleNotificationUrl**. The interval of these notifications is illustrated below:

```csharp
    //The following code is for illustrative purposes only
    var TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes=(TokenExpirationTime-CurrentTime)/4;
    if((TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes)<=180 && TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes>60){
        //Microsoft Graph will send reauthorizationRequired notification
        TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes=TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes/2;
    }
    elseif(TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes<60 && TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes>=0){
            //Microsoft Graph will send reauthorizationRequired notification every 15 mins
            TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes=TokenTimeToExpirationInMinutes-15;
    }else{
      //Microsoft Graph will stop sending reauthorizationRequired notifications
    }
```

The following steps represent the flow of an authorization challenge for an active subscription:

1. Microsoft Graph requires a subscription to be reauthorized.
    
    The reasons for this may vary from resource to resource, and may change over time. You must respond to a reauthorization event no matter what caused it.

2. Microsoft Graph sends an authorization challenge notification to the **lifecycleNotificationUrl**.

    Note that the flow of change notifications may continue for a while, giving you extra time to respond. However, eventually change notification delivery pauses, until you take the required action.

3. Respond to this lifecycle notification in one of two ways:
    - Reauthorize the subscription. This does not extend the expiration date of the subscription.
    - Renew the subscription. This reauthorizes and extends the expiration date.

    Note: Both actions require you to present a valid authentication token, similar to [creating a new subscription](webhooks.md#creating-a-subscription) or [renewing a subscription before its expiration](webhooks.md#renewing-a-subscription).

4. If you successfully reauthorize or renew the subscription, change notifications continue. Otherwise, change notifications remain paused. Please note that Microsoft graph will drop the notifications four hours after they are paused.

### reauthorizationRequired notification payload example

```json
{
  "value": [
    {
      "lifecycleEvent": "reauthorizationRequired",
      "subscriptionId": "e3898f08-5cd0-4a6a-80fc-6addbfb73b7b",
      "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2019-09-18T00:52:45.9696658+00:00",
      "clientState": "{secret client state}",
      "tenantId": "84bd8158-6d4d-4958-8b9f-9d6445542f95"
    }
  ]
}
```

A few things to note about this type of notification:

- The `"lifecycleEvent": "reauthorizationRequired"` field designates this notification as an authorization challenge. `missed` and `subscriptionRemoved` **lifecycleEvent** notifications are also supported.
- The lifecycle notification does not contain any information about a specific resource, because it is not related to a resource change, but to the subscription state change.

> **Note:** for a full description of the data sent when change notifications are delivered, see [changeNotificationCollection](/graph/api/resources/changenotificationcollection).

### Actions to take

1. [Acknowledge](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the receipt of the lifecycle notification, by responding to the POST call with `202 - Accepted`.
2. [Validate](webhooks.md#change-notifications) the authenticity of the lifecycle notification.
3. Ensure that the app has a valid access token to take the next step. 
  > **Note:** If you're using one of the [authentication libraries](/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-v2-libraries), they will handle this for you by either reusing a valid cached token, or obtaining a new token, including asking the user to sign in again (with a new password). Note that obtaining a new token might fail, because the conditions of access might have changed, and the caller might no longer be allowed access to the resource data.

4. Call either of the following two APIs. If the API call succeeds, the change notification flow resumes.

    - Call the `/reauthorize` action to reauthorize the subscription without extending its expiration date:
        ```http
        POST  https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions/{id}/reauthorize
        Content-type: application/json
        ```
    - Perform a regular renew action to reauthorize and renew the subscription at the same time:
        ```http
        PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions/{id}
        Content-Type: application/json

        {
           "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-21T11:00:00.0000000Z"
        }
        ```

      Renewing may fail, because the authorization checks performed by the system may deny the app or the user access to the resource. It may be necessary for the app to obtain a new access token from the user to successfully reauthorize a subscription. 
      
      You may retry these actions later, at any time, and succeed if the conditions of access change. Any notifications about resource changes that happen between the time the lifecycle notification was sent and the time when the app successfully creates the subscription again, would be lost. In such cases, the app should separately fetch those changes.

### Additional information

The following information can help you understand authorization challenges:

- Authorization challenges do not replace the need to renew a resource change subscription before it expires. 

    While you can choose to renew a subscription when you receive an authorization challenge, Microsoft Graph may not challenge all of your subscriptions. For example, a subscription that does not have any activity and has no change notifications pending delivery may not signal any reauthorization challenges to your app. Make sure to [renew subscriptions](webhooks.md#renewing-a-subscription) before they expire.

- The frequency of authorization challenges is subject to change.

    Do not make assumptions about the frequency of authorization challenges. These lifecycle notifications tell you when to take actions, saving you from having to track which subscriptions require reauthorization. Be ready to handle authorization challenges from once every few minutes for every subscription to rarely for only some of your subscriptions.

## Future-proof the code handling lifecycle notifications

In the future, Microsoft Graph will add more types of subscription lifecycle notifications. They will be posted to the same endpoint: **lifecycleNotificationUrl**, but they will have a different value under **lifecycleEvent** and might contain a slightly different schema and properties, specific to the scenario for which they will be issued.

You should implement your code in a future-proof way, so it does not break when Microsoft Graph introduces new types of lifecycle notifications. We recommend the following approach:

1. Explicitly identify each lifecycle notification as an event that you support, using the **lifecycleEvent** property. For example, look for the `"lifecycleEvent": "subscriptionRemoved"` property to identify a specific event, and handle it.

2. Watch for announcements of lifecycle notifications for new scenarios. There might be more types of lifecycle notifications in the future.

3. In your app, ignore any lifecycle notification that the app does not recognize, and log them to gain awareness.

4. At your discretion, look up the related documentation for new lifecycle notifications and implement support for them as appropriate.
