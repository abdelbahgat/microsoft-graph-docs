# Overview of group settings

Group settings (also called *directory settings* in `beta`) are a collection of settings that allow you to configure either tenant-wide or object-specific allowed behaviors for specific Microsoft Entra objects like Microsoft 365 groups.

There are eight groups of setting templates with each setting template including a collection of individual settings.

+ Group.Unified
+ Group.Unified.Guest
+ Application
+ Custom Policy Settings
+ Consent Policy Settings
+ Password Rule Settings - For more information, see [Configure custom banned passwords for Microsoft Entra password protection](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-configure-custom-password-protection)
+ Prohibited Names Restricted Settings
+ Prohibited Names Settings

The setting templates are available through the [groupSettingTemplates resource type](/graph/api/resources/groupsettingtemplate?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) in `v1.0` and [directorySettingTemplates](/graph/api/resources/directorysettingtemplate?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource type in `beta`. These setting templates are defined by Microsoft Entra ID and are read-only.

Initially, Microsoft Entra ID assigns the default configuration to the tenant and there are no setting objects. To change the default settings, you must create a new settings object from a settings template.

From the setting templates, you can configure tenant-wide settings or settings for individual objects. Use the [groupSettings resource type](/graph/api/resources/groupsetting?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) in `v1.0` or the [directorySetting resource type](/graph/api/resources/directorysetting?view=graph-rest-1.0&preserve-view=true) in `beta` and their associated APIs.

For groups, only settings for Microsoft 365 groups are available. The following article describes only settings that are available for Microsoft 365 groups.

## Group.Unified

This object specifies Microsoft 365 group settings for your tenant.

Unless otherwise indicated, these features require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license.

| Setting name | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| AllowGuestsToAccessGroups | Boolean | Indicates whether a guest user can have access to Microsoft 365 groups and their data. This setting doesn't require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license. |
| AllowGuestsToBeGroupOwner | Boolean | Indicates whether a guest user can be a Microsoft 365 group owner. |
| AllowToAddGuests | Boolean | Indicating whether a Microsoft 365 group can have guest users as members. This setting may be overridden and become read-only if **EnableMIPLabels** is `true` and a guest policy is associated with the sensitivity label assigned to the group. If this setting is `false` at the tenant-level, it overrides the corresponding group-level setting when it's `true`. To enable guest access for only a few Microsoft 365 groups, set **AllowToAddGuests** to be `true` at the tenant-level, and then selectively disable this setting for individual Microsoft 365 groups to exclude. |
| ClassificationDescriptions | String | A comma-delimited list of classification descriptions. The value of ClassificationDescriptions is only valid in this format: `"Value:Description"` where *Value* matches an entry in the **ClassificationList** setting. This setting doesn't apply when **EnableMIPLabels** is `true`. Maximum character limit is 300 and commas can't be escaped. |
| ClassificationList | String | A comma-delimited list of values that can be applied to classify Microsoft 365 groups. This setting doesn't apply when **EnableMIPLabels** is `true`. For more information, see [SharePoint "modern" sites classification](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/modern-experience-site-classification). |
| CustomBlockedWordsList | String | Comma-separated string of phrases that users won't be permitted to use in group names or aliases. For more information, see [Enforce a naming policy for Microsoft 365 groups](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-naming-policy). |
| DefaultClassification | String | The classification that's used as the default classification for a Microsoft 365 group if none was specified during group creation. This setting doesn't apply when **EnableMIPLabels** is `true`. For more information, see [SharePoint "modern" sites classification](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/modern-experience-site-classification). |
| EnableGroupCreation | Boolean | Indicates whether non-admin users can create Microsoft 365 groups. The default setting is `true`. This setting doesn't require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license. This setting corresponds to the _Users can create Microsoft 365 groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell_ setting in the [group settings menu in the Microsoft Entra admin center](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management). <br/><br/> **Note:** _The Users can create security groups in Azure portals, API or PowerShell_ setting is configured through the **allowedToCreateSecurityGroups** property of the [defaultUserRolePermissions](/graph/api/resources/defaultuserrolepermissions) object of the [authorizationPolicy resource type](/graph/api/resources/authorizationpolicy).|
| EnableMSStandardBlockedWords | Boolean | Deprecated and retired. |
| EnableMIPLabels | Boolean | Indicates whether Microsoft information protection sensitivity labels published in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal can be applied to Microsoft 365 groups. For more information, see [Assign Sensitivity Labels for Microsoft 365 groups](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels). |
| GroupCreationAllowedGroupId | GUID | Identifier of the security group for which the members are allowed to create Microsoft 365 groups even when **EnableGroupCreation** is `false`. This setting doesn't require a Microsoft Entra ID P1 license. |
| GuestUsageGuidelinesUrl | String | The URL of a link to the guest usage guidelines. |
| NewUnifiedGroupWritebackDefault | Boolean | A tenant-wide setting that assigns the default value to the **writebackConfiguration/isEnabled** property of new groups, if the property isn't specified during group creation. This setting is applicable when group writeback is configured in Microsoft Entra Connect. The default value is `true`. <br/><br/>Updating this setting to `false` changes the default writeback behavior for new Microsoft 365 groups, but won't change **writebackConfiguration/isEnabled** property for existing Microsoft 365 groups. For more information about this setting and the group's **writebackConfiguration** property, see [group resource type](/graph/api/resources/group?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) |
| PrefixSuffixNamingRequirement | String | Defines the naming convention configured for Microsoft 365 group names and mail nicknames. Maximum character limit is 64. For more information, see [Enforce a naming policy for Microsoft 365 groups](/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-naming-policy). |
| UsageGuidelinesUrl | String | A link to the Group Usage Guidelines. The default is an empty value. |

## Group.Unified.Guest

The settings in this object specify whether guests can be added to all or specific Microsoft 365 groups in the tenant.

Only one setting is available in this collection.

| Setting name | Type | Description |
|--|--|--|
| AllowToAddGuests | Boolean | Indicates whether guest users can be added to all or specific Microsoft 365 groups. The default setting is `true`. This setting can be overwritten when: <br/><li>**EnableMIPLabels** is `true` and a guest policy is applied when a sensitivity label is assigned to a group </ul><li>**AllowToAddGuests** is `false` at the tenant-level, the group-level setting is overwritten </ul> |
