# Add custom data to resources using extensions

Microsoft Graph provides a single API endpoint to access rich people-centric data and insights through resources such as [user](/graph/api/resources/user) and [message](/graph/api/resources/message). You can also extend Microsoft Graph by adding custom properties to resource instances without requiring an external data store.

In this article, we'll discuss how Microsoft Graph supports extending its resources, the options available to add custom properties and when to use them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not use extensions to store sensitive personally identifiable information, such as account credentials, government identification numbers, cardholder data, financial account data, healthcare information, or sensitive background information.

## Why add custom properties to Microsoft Graph?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You should not use extensions to store sensitive personally identifiable information, such as account credentials, government identification numbers, cardholder data, financial account data, healthcare information, or sensitive background information.
* As an ISV developer, you might decide to keep your app lightweight and store app-specific user profile data in Microsoft Graph by extending the **user** resource.
* Alternatively, you might want to retain your appâ€™s existing user profile store, and add an app-specific identifier to the **user** resource.
* As an enterprise developer, the in-house applications that you build might rely on your organization's HR-specific data. Integration within multiple applications can be simplified by storing this data in custom properties in Microsoft Graph.

## Custom property options in Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph offers four types of extensions for adding custom properties.

- Extension attributes properties
- Directory (Azure AD) extensions
- Schema extensions
- Open extensions

### Extension attributes

Azure AD offers a set of 15 custom properties with predefined names on the [user](/graph/api/resources/onpremisesextensionattributes) and [device](/graph/api/resources/onpremisesextensionattributes) resources. These properties were initially custom attributes provided in on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Exchange. However, they can now be used for more than syncing on-premises AD and Microsoft Exchange data to Azure AD through Microsoft Graph.

#### Developer experience

You can use the 15 extension attributes to store String values on **user** or **device** resource instances, through the **onPremisesExtensionAttributes** and **extensionAttributes** properties respectively. The values may be assigned when creating a new resource instance or when updating an existing resource instance. They can also be filtered.

##### Add or update data in extension attributes

The following example shows how to store data in **extensionAttribute1** and delete existing data from **extensionAttribute12** through an update operation with a PATCH method.

```msgraph-interactive
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/071cc716-8147-4397-a5ba-b2105951cc0b

{
    "onPremisesExtensionAttributes": {
        "extensionAttribute1": "skypeId.adeleVance",
        "extensionAttribute13": null
    }
}
```

The request returns a `204 No Content` response object.

##### Retrieve data from extension attributes 1-15

###### Request

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users?$select=id,displayName,onPremisesExtensionAttributes
```

###### Response

```http
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users(id,displayName,onPremisesExtensionAttributes)",
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "071cc716-8147-4397-a5ba-b2105951cc0b",
            "displayName": "Adele Vance",
            "onPremisesExtensionAttributes": {
                "extensionAttribute1": "Contractor",
                "extensionAttribute2": "50",
                "extensionAttribute3": null,
                "extensionAttribute4": "1478354",
                "extensionAttribute5": "10239390",
                "extensionAttribute6": null,
                "extensionAttribute7": null,
                "extensionAttribute8": null,
                "extensionAttribute9": null,
                "extensionAttribute10": "11",
                "extensionAttribute11": null,
                "extensionAttribute12": "/o=ExchangeLabs/ou=Exchange Administrative Group (FYDIBOHF47SPDLT)/cn=Recipients/cn=5ee781fc7egc7aa0b9394bddb44e7f04-Adele Vance",
                "extensionAttribute13": null,
                "extensionAttribute14": null,
                "extensionAttribute15": null
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Directory (Azure AD) extensions

[Directory extensions](/graph/api/resources/extensionProperty) provide developers with a strongly-typed, discoverable and filterable extension experience for directory objects.

Directory extensions are first registered on an application through the [Create extensionProperty](/graph/api/application-post-extensionproperty) operation and must be explicitly targeted to specific directory objects. After the application has been consented to by a user or an admin, the extension properties become immediately accessible in the tenant. All authorized applications in the tenant can read and write data on any extension properties defined on an instance of the target directory object.

For the list of resource types that can be specified as target objects for a directory extension, see [Choose an extension type for your application](#choose-an-extension-type-for-your-application).

#### Developer experience

Directory extension definitions are managed through the [extensionProperty](/graph/api/resources/extensionproperty) resource and its associated methods. The data is managed through the same REST requests that you use to manage the resource instance.

##### Create a directory extension definition

Before you can add a directory extension to a resource instance, you must first create a directory extension definition.

###### Request

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/30a5435a-1871-485c-8c7b-65f69e287e7b/extensionProperties

{
    "name": "jobGroupTracker",
    "dataType": "String",
    "targetObjects": [
        "User"
    ]
}
```

###### Response

A directory extension property named `extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker` is created with an extension name that follows the following naming convention: *extension_{appId-without-hyphens}_{extensionProperty-name}*.

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#applications('30a5435a-1871-485c-8c7b-65f69e287e7b')/extensionProperties/$entity",
    "id": "4e3dbc8f-ca32-41b4-825a-346215d7d20f",
    "deletedDateTime": null,
    "appDisplayName": "HR-sync-app",
    "dataType": "String",
    "isSyncedFromOnPremises": false,
    "name": "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker",
    "targetObjects": [
        "User"
    ]
}
```

##### Add a directory extension property to a target object

After creating the directory extension definition, you can now add it to an instance of a target object type. You can store data in the directory extension property when creating a new instance of the target object or when updating an existing object. The following example shows how to store data in the directory extension property when creating a new user object.

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users

{
    "accountEnabled": true,
    "displayName": "Adele Vance",
    "mailNickname": "AdeleV",
    "userPrincipalName": "AdeleV@contoso.com",
    "passwordProfile": {
        "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn": false,
        "password": "xWwvJ]6NMw+bWH-d"
    },
    "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker": "JobGroupN"
}
```

The request returns a `201 Created` response code and a [user](/graph/api/resources/user) object in the response body.

##### Retrieve a directory extension property

The following example shows how the directory extension properties and associated data are presented on a resource instance. The extension property will be returned by default through the `beta` endpoint, but only on `$select` through the `v1.0` endpoint.

##### Request

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users?$select=id,displayName,extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker,extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_permanent_pensionable
```

##### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users(id,displayName,extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker,extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_permanent_pensionable)",
    "value": [
        {
            "id": "63384f56-42d2-4aa7-b1d6-b10c78f143a2",
            "displayName": "Adele Vance",
            "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker": "E4",
            "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_permanent_pensionable": true
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Update or delete directory extension properties

To update or delete the value of the directory extension property for a resource instance, use the PATCH method. To delete the extension property and its associated value from the resource instance, set its value to `null`.

The following request updates the value of one directory extension property and deletes another extension property.

```msgraph-interactive
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/63384f56-42d2-4aa7-b1d6-b10c78f143a2

{
    "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_permanent_pensionable": null,
    "extension_b7d8e648520f41d3b9c0fdeb91768a0a_jobGroupTracker": "E4"
}
```

The request returns a `204 No Content` response code.

### Schema extensions

[Microsoft Graph schema extensions](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension) are conceptually similar to directory extensions. First, you create your schema extension definition. Then, use it to extend supported resource instances with strongly-typed custom properties. In addition, you can control the [status](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension#schema-extensions-lifecycle) of your schema extension and let it be discoverable by other apps.

For the list of resource types that support schema extensions, see [Choose an extension type for your application](#choose-an-extension-type-for-your-application).

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MOAlUFNus0]

#### Developer experience

When creating a schema extension definition, you must provide a unique name for its **id**. There are two naming options:

- If you already have a vanity `.com`,`.net`, `.gov`, `.edu` or a `.org` domain that you've verified with your tenant, you can use the domain name along with the schema name to define a unique name, in this format *{domainName}*_*{schemaName}*. For example, if your vanity domain is `contoso.com`, you can define an **id** of `contoso_mySchema`. This option is highly recommended.
- If you donâ€™t have a verified vanity domain, you can set the **id** to a schema name (without a domain name prefix). For example, `mySchema`. Microsoft Graph will assign a string ID for you based on the supplied name, in this format: `ext{8-random-alphanumeric-chars}_{schema-name}`. For example, `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.

The **id** will be the name of the complex type that will store your data on the extended resource instance.

Once a schema extension is registered, it's available to be used by all applications in the same tenant as the associated owner application (when in the `InDevelopment` state) or by all applications in any tenant (when in the `Available` state). Like directory extensions, authorized apps have the ability to read and write data on any extensions defined on the target object.

Unlike open extensions, you manage the [schema extension definitions](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension) and their data on the extended resource instance as separate sets of API operations. To manage the schema extension data on the extended resource instance, use the same REST request that you use to manage the resource instance.

##### Create a schema extension definition

###### Request

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/schemaExtensions

{
    "id": "graphLearnCourses",
    "description": "Graph Learn training courses extensions",
    "targetTypes": [
        "user"
    ],
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "courseId",
            "type": "Integer"
        },
        {
            "name": "courseName",
            "type": "String"
        },
        {
            "name": "courseType",
            "type": "String"
        }
    ]
}
```

###### Response

```http
{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#schemaExtensions/$entity",
    "id": "extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses",
    "description": "Graph Learn training courses extensions",
    "targetTypes": [
        "user"
    ],
    "status": "InDevelopment",
    "properties": [
        {
            "name": "courseId",
            "type": "Integer"
        },
        {
            "name": "courseName",
            "type": "String"
        },
        {
            "name": "courseType",
            "type": "String"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Add a schema extension to a resource instance

After creating the schema extension definition, you can now add the extension property to an instance of a target object type. You can store data in the schema extension when creating a new instance of the target object or when updating an existing object. The following example shows how to store data in the schema extension property when creating a new user object.

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/

{
    "accountEnabled": true,
    "displayName": "Adele Vance",
    "mailNickname": "AdeleV",
    "userPrincipalName": "AdeleV@m365x72712789.onmicrosoft.com",
    "passwordProfile": {
        "forceChangePasswordNextSignIn": false,
        "password": "xWwvJ]6NMw+bWH-d"
    },
    "extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses": {
        "courseId": 100,
        "courseName": "Explore Microsoft Graph",
        "courseType": "Online"
    }
}
```

The request returns a `201 Created` response code and a [schemaExtension](/graph/api/resources/schemaextension) object in the response body

##### Update or delete a schema extension property

Use the PATCH operation to update a schema extension property or delete an existing schema extension object. To delete the extension property and its associated value from the resource instance, set its value to `null`.

The following example deletes the value of the **courseId** property and updates the **courseType** property. To delete the `extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses` extension property in its entirety, set its value to `null`.

```msgraph-interactive
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/0668e673-908b-44ea-861d-0661297e1a3e

{
    "extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses": {
        "courseType": "Instructor-led",
        "courseId": null
    }
}
```

The request returns a `204 No Content` response object.

##### Retrieve the schema extension property

To read the schema extension properties on a resource instance, specify the extension name in a `$select` request.

###### Request
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/users/0668e673-908b-44ea-861d-0661297e1a3e?$select=id,displayName,extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses
```

###### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users(id,displayName,extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses)/$entity",
    "id": "63384f56-42d2-4aa7-b1d6-b10c78f143a2",
    "displayName": "Adele Vance",
    "extkmpdyld2_graphLearnCourses": {
        "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.ComplexExtensionValue",
        "courseType": "Instructor-led",
        "courseName": "Explore Microsoft Graph",
        "courseId": null
    }
}
```

For more information about how to use schema extensions to add custom properties and associated data, see [schemaExtension resource type](/graph/api/resources/schemextension) and [Add custom properties to groups using schema extensions](extensibility-schema-groups.md).

### Open extensions

[Microsoft Graph open extensions](/graph/api/resources/opentypeextension) are [open types](https://www.odata.org/getting-started/advanced-tutorial/#openType) that offer a simple and flexible way to add untyped data directly to a resource instance. These extensions aren't strongly-typed, discoverable, or filterable.

For the list of resource types that support Microsoft Graph open extensions, see [Choose an extension type for your application](#choose-an-extension-type-for-your-application).

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ibdlADb8IZc]

#### Developer experience

Open extensions, together with their data, are accessible through the **extensions** navigation property of the resource instance. They allow you to group related properties for easier access and management.

The **extensionName** property is the only *pre-defined*, writable property in an open extension. When creating an open extension, you must assign the **extensionName** property a name that is unique within the tenant. One way to do this is to use a reverse domain name system (DNS) format that is dependent on *your own domain*, for example, `Com.Contoso.ContactInfo`. **Do not use the Microsoft domain (`Com.Microsoft` or `Com.OnMicrosoft`) in an extension name**.

##### Create an open extension

The following example shows an open extension definition with three properties and how the custom properties and associated data is presented on a resource instance.

```msgraph-interactive
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/3fbd929d-8c56-4462-851e-0eb9a7b3a2a5/extensions

{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
    "extensionName": "com.contoso.socialSettings",
    "skypeId": "skypeId.AdeleV",
    "linkedInProfile": "www.linkedin.com/in/testlinkedinprofile",
    "xboxGamerTag": "AwesomeAdele",
    "id": "com.contoso.socialSettings"
}
```

The request returns a `201 Created` response code and an [openTypeExtension](/graph/api/resources/opentypeextension) object in the response body.

##### Update an existing open extension

To update an open extension, you must specify all its properties in the request body. Otherwise, the unspecified properties will be updated to `null` and deleted from the open extension.

The following request specifies only the **linkedInProfile** and **xboxGamerTag** properties. The value of the **xboxGamerTag** property is being updated while the **linkedInProfile** property remains the same. This request also deletes the unspecified **skypeId** property.

```msgraph-interactive
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/3fbd929d-8c56-4462-851e-0eb9a7b3a2a5/extensions/com.contoso.socialSettings

{
    "xboxGamerTag": "FierceAdele",
    "linkedInProfile": "www.linkedin.com/in/testlinkedinprofile"
}
```
This request returns a `204 No Content` response code.


##### Retrieve the open extensions

```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/3fbd929d-8c56-4462-851e-0eb9a7b3a2a5/extensions/com.contoso.socialSettings

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/$metadata#users('3fbd929d-8c56-4462-851e-0eb9a7b3a2a5')/extensions/$entity",
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
    "xboxGamerTag": "FierceAdele",
    "linkedInProfile": "www.linkedin.com/in/testlinkedinprofile",
    "id": "com.contoso.socialSettings"
}
```

This limit applies to the following Outlook resources: **message**, **event**, and **contact**
>
> You can manage all extensions when you're signed in with a work or school account. Additionally, you can manage open extensions for the following resources when signed-in with a personal Microsoft account: **event**, **post**, **group**, **message**, **contact**, and **user**.

## Permissions

The same [permissions](./permissions-reference.md) that are required to read from or write to a specific resource are also required to read from or write to any extensions data on that resource. For example, for an app to update any user's profile with custom app data, the app must have been granted the *User.ReadWrite.All* permission.

## Known limitations

For known limitations using extensions, see the [extensions section](known-issues.md#extensions) in the known issues article.
