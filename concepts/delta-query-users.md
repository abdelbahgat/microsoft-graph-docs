# Get incremental changes for users

The [delta query](./delta-query-overview.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you query for additions, deletions, or updates to [supported resources](delta-query-overview.md#supported-resources). It is enabled through a series of [delta](/graph/api/user-delta) requests. For users, the delta query enables you to discover changes without fetching the entire set of users to compare changes.

Clients that synchronize users with a local profile store can use the delta query for both their initial full synchronization along with subsequent incremental synchronizations. Typically, a client would do an initial full synchronization of all the users in a tenant, and then, get incremental changes to users periodically.

## Track changes to users

Track user changes through one or more GET requests with the **delta** function. The GET request is like a [list users](/graph/api/user-list) request, except with the following extra objects in the URL:

- The **delta** function.
- A [state token](./delta-query-overview.md) (_deltaToken_ or _skipToken_) from the previous GET **delta** function call.

## Example: track changes to users

The following example shows a series of requests to track changes to users:

1. An [initial request](#initial-request) and [response](#initial-response)
2. A [nextLink request](#nextlink-request) and [response](#nextlink-response)
3. A [final nextLink request](#final-nextlink-request) and [response](#final-nextlink-response)
4. A [deltaLink request](#deltalink-request) and [deltaLink response](#deltalink-response)

Take note of the following in the responses:

- When the user is deleted, the item contains an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "changed"`.
- When the user is permanently deleted, the item contains  an annotation: `@removed` with value of `"reason": "deleted"`.
- When the user is created, or restored, there's no annotation.

### Initial request

To track changes in the user resource, make a request and include the **delta** function as a URL segment.

Take note of the following items:

- The optional `$select` query parameter is included in the request to demonstrate how query parameters are automatically included in future requests.
- The initial request doesn't include a state token. State tokens will be used in subsequent requests.

### Initial response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and [user](/graph/api/resources/user) collection object in the response body. Assuming the entire set of users is too large, the response will also include a `@odata.nextLink` state token in an `@odata.nextLink` parameter.

In this example, a `@odata.nextLink` URL is returned indicating there are more pages of data to be retrieved in the session. The `$select` query parameter from the initial request is encoded into the `@odata.nextLink` URL.

### nextLink request

The second request specifies the `skipToken` returned from the previous response. Notice the `$select` parameter is encoded and included in the `skipToken`.

### nextLink response

The response contains another `@odata.nextLink` with a new `skipToken` value, which indicates that more changes that were tracked for users are available. Use the `@odata.nextLink` URL in more requests until a `@odata.deltaLink` URL (in an `@odata.deltaLink` parameter) is returned in the final response, even if the value is an empty array.

### Final nextLink response

When a `@odata.deltaLink` URL is returned, there's no more data about the existing state of the user objects. For future requests, the application uses the `@odata.deltaLink` URL to learn about other changes to users. Save the `deltaToken` and use it in the subsequent request URL to discover more changes to users.

### deltaLink request

Using the `deltaToken` from the [last response](#final-nextlink-response), you'll get changes (additions, deletions, or updates) to users since the last request.

## deltaLink response

If no changes have occurred, a `@odata.deltaLink` is returned with no results - the **value** property is an empty array.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.user"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@odata.context":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users",
  "@odata.deltaLink":"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/delta?$deltatoken=MF1LuFYbK6Lw4DtZ4o9PDrcGekRP65WEJfDmM0H26l4v9zILCPFiPwSAAeRBghxgiwsXEfywcVQ9R8VEWuYAB50Yw3KvJ-8Z1zamVotGX2b_AHVS_Z-3b0NAtmGpod",
  "value": []
}
```

If changes have occurred, a collection of changed user objects is included. The response also contains either a `@odata.nextLink` - in case there are multiple pages of changes to retrieve - or a `@odata.deltaLink`. Implement the same pattern of following the `@odata.nextLink` and persist the final `@odata.deltaLink` for future calls.

> [!NOTE]
> This request might have replication delays for users that were recently created, updated, or deleted. Retry the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` after some time to retrieve the latest changes.
