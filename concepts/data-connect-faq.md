# Microsoft Graph Data Connect frequently asked questions

Microsoft Graph Data Connect lets developers create applications that customers can use to provide managed access to their at-scale Microsoft Graph datasets. This article provides tips that will help you take advantage of the Data Connect feature. For an introduction to Microsoft Graph Data Connect, see the [overview](data-connect-concept-overview.md).

## Is Microsoft Graph Data Connect right for me?

Data Connect and Microsoft Graph APIs provide access to the same underlying data but in very different ways. Data Connect is designed to extract large amounts of data in bulk, while Microsoft Graph APIs are more suitable for accessing discrete sets of data in real time. In some cases, it might even make sense to combine them. For example, you might want to use Data Connect to do an initial extraction of the last year of email data, and then use Microsoft Graph APIs to analyze emails in real time moving forward. Data Connect and Microsoft Graph APIs are different tools for different jobs. It's important to think about which access method best fits your scenario. For more information, see [When should I use Microsoft Graph API or Data Connect](/graph/overview#when-should-i-use-microsoft-graph-api-or-data-connect).

## Is there any initial overhead?

Because Data Connect is designed to extract large amounts of data in bulk, some overhead is incurred before the data can be extracted. This overhead is around 45 minutes, which means that all pipelines take at least that long regardless of the data size. This might be a negligible cost for large amounts of data, but if this time is unacceptable for your scenario, Microsoft Graph APIs might provide a better approach.

## How much do I have to pay for Data Connect?

Microsoft Graph Data Connect consumption charges are billed monthly on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Data Connect billing unit is in a multiple of 1000s of objects, where 1 object maps to 1 individual instance of an entity in Microsoft 365. For example, 1 email == 1 object, 1 file == 1 object, 1 Teams chat message == 1 object, and so on. Charges are calculated by using a flat rate based on the count of per-1,000 objects extracted through the connector. There is no charge for extraction of objects from the following datasets:

- BasicDataSet_v0.User
- BasicDataSet_v0.MailboxSettings
- BasicDataSet_v0.Manager
- BasicDataSet_v0.DirectReport

## In what regions is Data Connect available?

Microsoft Graph Data Connect is currently available in the following regions: North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Australia. Other regions will follow.

## What datasets are available through Data Connect?

Microsoft Graph Data Connect currently includes the following datasets:

* Teams: 1:1, 1:N, and meeting chat messages
* Outlook: messages, events, contacts, sent items, user entity, mailbox settings, calendar view, manager and direct reports, and mail folders

We plan to add new datasets going forward and will disclose timelines as appropriate. However, it is unlikely that we will expose every Microsoft Graph dataset through Microsoft Graph Data Connect.

## What scenarios does Data Connect best address?

Organizations that can tap into the large datasets that power their productivity tools can gain tremendous insights into the challenges and opportunities they might encounter. During our public preview, we've seen customers interested in sales productivity, data archiving and management, organizational optimization, intelligent workflows, and ensuring compliance.

## Is it possible for my data to stay within the organization's subscription with Data Connect?

Microsoft Graph Data Connect pipelines are orchestrated by Azure Data Factory, a data integration service that runs in an Azure subscription. The Azure subscription is [associated with exactly one Microsoft 365 tenant](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-how-subscriptions-associated-directory). This way, the data must initially flow to an associated Azure subscription. After further minimalization and aggregation, the data can be used elsewhere.

If you want to build an app for others to use to extract their Microsoft 365 data, you can package the app as an [Azure managed application](/azure/managed-applications/overview) and publish it to the Azure Marketplace. Then someone can deploy your app into their own Azure subscription, and the app can access data in their tenant.

## Are service principals required with Data Connect?

When creating the Data Factory pipeline, you have to provide a service principal to the Microsoft 365 linked service. In Azure, a service principal is a security identity that represents an application/service (as opposed to a user). Microsoft Graph Data Connect uses this service principal as its identity when getting authorized access to your Microsoft 365 data.

If you create an Azure managed application for others to use in their tenants, you still provide a service principal for the app to use. This service principal exists in your (the publisher's) tenant. However, if the app needs other service principals, your customer (the installer) creates them in their own tenant. For example, your Data Factory pipeline likely needs access to a storage resource in Azure. The customer creates the service principal with permissions to the storage account for the pipeline to use.

## How can I check for pending Privileged Access Management requests?

Before Microsoft Graph Data Connect can copy your data, an administrator must approve a Privileged Access Management (PAM) request. PAM is the mechanism used to authorize your data pipeline access to the data in Microsoft 365. The first time you trigger a pipeline, it waits for a Microsoft 365 administrator (or appointed delegate) to approve the access request. Although the pipeline status shows **In progress**, the underlying copy activity will have a status of **ConsentPending** until approval is granted, as shown in the following screenshot.

During development, it's a good idea to make sure that your pipeline runs aren't stuck on **ConsentPending**, especially after you make a change to your pipeline. For example, if you add an additional field to the schema, the next pipeline run issues a new PAM request that has to be approved. Don't waste time waiting on a pipeline that's waiting for your approval.

## How can I approve PAM requests via the Microsoft 365 admin center?

The Data Connect documentation shows you how to use PowerShell and the PAM UX to approve PAM requests. To approve using the PAM UX, visit the PAM interface in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?source=applauncher#/Settings/PrivilegedAccess). The admin center provides an easy and user-friendly way to view and approve/deny/revoke PAM requests. You can find a link to it in the Microsoft Graph Data Connect add-in under **Settings** > **Services & Add-ins** > **Microsoft Graph Data Connect**.

## Can I have a second user to approve PAM requests?

When you run a pipeline and trigger a PAM request, the request is attached to your user account that owns the service principal used by the pipeline. But even if this account is part of the approver group that you set up, you can't use it to approve the PAM request because self-approvals are not allowed. If you try, you'll get an error message in the PAM portal: "Requestor and approver are the same. Self-approval is not allowed." For development, you'll want to have a second account in addition to the admin who approves requests. Both the submitter and the approver must have active Exchange Online accounts.

## Can I deduplicate emails when needed?

When you extract emails from the `Message` dataset, there are often multiple JSON objects for the same email. These duplicates exist because when an email is sent to multiple people, there is a copy of the email in every recipient's mailbox. Because the dataset is extracted from every mailbox, it contains all copies across users. In some scenarios, it might be necessary to keep every copy, but in others, you might want to remove the duplicates.

You can deduplicate the exported JSON objects based on the `internetMessageId` of the messages: two messages with the same `internetMessageId` are duplicate copies of the same instance. Because the duplicates can exist in different blobs, you must deduplicate across all blobs rather than deduplicating in each blob separately.

## Can I use the puser field to determine the relevant user?

The extracted data includes some meta properties that don't exist when using the corresponding Microsoft Graph APIs. Specifically, the `puser` field can be useful for determining which user the data was extracted from. In the scenario where you have two copies of the same email in different mailboxes, you can use the `puser` field to determine which copy came from which mailbox. The `puser` field is also useful for datasets such as the `Manager` dataset. The exported JSON contains information about a manager, but this is only useful if you know whose manager they are. The `puser` field tells you whose manager that JSON object corresponds to.

## Is hybrid mode tenant setup supported?

If your Microsoft 365 setup has some users in Exchange Online and some users in Exchange on-premises, then the users who are in Exchange on-premises would not be supported. Unfortunately, we do not currently support Data Connect for Exchange on-premises users.

## Are resource accounts supported?

We don't currently support access to messages or events from resource accounts.

## Why do I sometimes see multiple files per ADF pipeline run but other times see only one file per run?

Microsoft Graph Data Connect takes the user list for each pipeline run and then distributes the dataset extraction and curation across multiple jobs that run in parallel. For each parallel run, one output file is generated in the data sink defined by you. In some cases, if the user list is small, they might be mapped into one extraction and curation job, and in those cases only one output file would be generated in the data sink.

## How is billing computed when the count of objects is not a round number?

For billing purposes, Microsoft Graph Data Connect rounds up the extracted object count to the nearest 1000. For example, if you extract 125 objects or 999 objects, you are billed for 1000 objects. Similarly, if you extract between 1001 to 2000 objects, you are billed for 2000 objects.

## Why does my Microsoft 365 copy data activity always fail when initialized via Azure Synapse?

We do not currently support initializing Microsoft 365 copy data activity via Azure Synapse. We are working toward adding the integration for Azure Synapse initialized activity and will update our documentation when this is completed.
