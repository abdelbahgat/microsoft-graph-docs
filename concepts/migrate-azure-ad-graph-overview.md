# Migrate your apps from Azure AD Graph to Microsoft Graph

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph is deprecated and will be retired at any time after June 30, 2023, without advance notice, as [we announced in September, 2022](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454#:~:text=for%20Header%20keys.-,Azure%20AD%20Graph%20API,-Azure%20AD%20Graph). Though we reserve the right to turn it off after June 30, 2023, we want to ensure all customers migrate off and discourage applications from taking production dependencies on Azure AD Graph. Investments in new features and functionalities will only be made in Microsoft Graph and we'll only make security-related fixes to Azure AD Graph.

## Why use Microsoft Graph?

Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Azure AD services and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. Microsoft Graph API's usage has more than doubled that of Azure AD Graph, and in the past two years we have added [167 new features](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/changelog). All new functionalities will only be available through the Microsoft Graph.

Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.

Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.

Switch to Microsoft Graph to take advantage of these enhanced capabilities and:

- [Microsoft 365 group management](/graph/office365-groups-concept-overview).
- [External user invitations](/graph/api/resources/invitation).
- The ability to [restore users, Microsoft 365 groups, applications, and service principals](/graph/api/resources/directory) after they've been deleted.
- [Webhook notifications on users and groups](/graph/webhooks).
- Advanced license management features including [group-based licensing](/graph/api/group-assignlicense).
- Identity governance features such as:
  - [Privileged identity management](/graph/api/resources/privilegedidentitymanagementv3-overview) (PIM) to elevate users to privileged roles only when needed and for a limited time period.
  - [Access reviews](/graph/api/resources/accessreviewsv2-overview) for one-time or recurring access reviews for attestation of user's access rights.
  - [Terms-of-use](/graph/api/resources/agreement) to enable organizations to present information for legal or compliance requirements, like disclaimer notices.
- Security features such as:
  - [Identity risk events](/graph/api/resources/riskdetection).
  - [Risky users](/graph/api/resources/riskyuser).
- [Client libraries and samples](/graph/) available on many more platforms and languages. Microsoft Graph SDKs provide a discoverable interface to easily access your data while transparently handling token acquisition, retry handling due to errors and throttling, secure redirect handling and model serialization and deserialization.
- More [OData query capabilities](/graph/query-parameters) supported by resources such as users, groups, applications, and service principals.

- A checklist to help you plan the migration.
- Guidance describing specific differences between the APIs.
- Links to more resources and examples to illustrate specific differences.
- An FAQ to address other questions or concerns.
