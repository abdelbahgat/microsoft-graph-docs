# Add custom data to users using open extensions
This article walks you through an example to demonstrate how to use *open extensions*. 

Imagine you're building an application that is available on lots of different client platforms, such as desktop and mobile.  You want to let users configure their UI experience so itâ€™s consistent no matter which device they use to sign in to your app. This is a common requirement for most apps. 

For this scenario, this article will show you how to:

1. Add an open extension representing some roaming profile information about the user.
2. Query the user and return the roaming profile.
3. Change the user's roaming profile information (the open extension value).
4. Delete the user's roaming profile information.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic shows you how to add, read, update and delete open extensions on a **user** resource. Open extensions are also supported and can be managed for [other resource types](extensibility-overview.md).

## 1. Add roaming profile information
The user signs in to the app and configures the look and feel of the app.  These app settings should roam so that the user gets the same experience on 
whatever device they sign in to the app from.  Here we'll see how to add the roaming profile information to a user resource.

### Request
```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/extensions
Content-type: application/json
{
    "@odata.type":"microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
    "extensionName":"com.contoso.roamingSettings",
    "theme":"dark",
    "color":"purple",
    "lang":"Japanese"
}
```
### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
    "extensionName": "com.contoso.roamingSettings",
    "id": "com.contoso.roamingSettings",
    "theme": "dark",
    "color": "purple",
    "lang": "Japanese"
}
```

## 2. Retrieve roaming profile information
When the user signs in to the app from another device, the app can retrieve the user's profile details as well as their roaming settings. This can be done by getting the user's resource and expanding the extension navigation property.

### Request
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me?$select=id,displayName,mail,mobilePhone&$expand=extensions
```
### Response
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "84b80893-8749-40a3-97b7-68513b600544",
    "displayName": "John Smith",
    "mail": "john@contoso.com",
    "mobilePhone": "1-555-6589",
    "extensions": [
        {
            "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.openTypeExtension",
            "extensionName": "com.contoso.roamingSettings",
            "id": "com.contoso.roamingSettings",
            "theme": "dark",
            "color": "purple",
            "lang": "Japanese"
        }
    ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have multiple extensions, you can filter on the **id** to get the extension that you're interested in.

## 3. Change roaming profile information
The user can choose to change their roaming profile information.  This update can be done with a ```PATCH``` on the open extension value. 

### Request
```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/extensions/com.contoso.roamingSettings
Content-type: application/json
{
    "theme":"light",
    "color":"yellow",
    "lang":"Swahili"
}
```

### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No content
```

## 4. Delete a user's roaming profile
The user decides that they don't want a roaming profile anymore, so they delete it. This can be done with a ```DELETE``` request on the open extension value.

### Request
```http
DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/extensions/com.contoso.roamingSettings
```

### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 204 No content
```
