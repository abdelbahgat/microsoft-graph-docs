## Known limitations

The following limitations apply to metered APIs:

- Metered APIs and services in Microsoft Graph are currently available only in the Microsoft global environment and not in national cloud deployments, including Microsoft 365 GCC deployments accessed through the worldwide Microsoft Graph endpoint. For details about national clouds, see [National cloud deployments](/graph/deployments).
- The target application must be a confidential client application (for example, web application, web API, or daemon/service). Public client applications (desktop and mobile applications) are not supported.
