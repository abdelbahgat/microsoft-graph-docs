In this step, you will build and run the sample. This code sample will create a new connection, register the schema, and then push items from the [ApplianceParts.csv](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-search-connector-sample/blob/main/PartsInventoryConnector/ApplianceParts.csv) file into that connection.

1. Open your command-line interface (CLI) in the **PartsInventoryConnector** directory.
2. Use the command `dotnet build` to build the sample.
3. Use the command `dotnet run` to run the sample.
4. Select **1. Create a connection**. Enter a unique identifier, name, and description for that connection.
5. Select **2. Register schema for the current connection option**, and then wait for the operation to complete.
6. Select **3. Push all items to current connection**.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If step 5 results in an error, wait a few minutes, and then select **3. Push all items to current connection**.
