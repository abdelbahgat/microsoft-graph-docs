# Get change notifications for membership changes in teams and channels using Microsoft Graph

Change notifications enable you to subscribe to membership changes (create, update, and delete) in teams and private channels. You can get notified whenever a member is added, removed, or updated in a team or in a private channel. You can also get the resource data in the notifications and therefore avoid calling the API to get the payload.

## Subscribe to changes in membership of a particular team

To get change notifications for membership changes in a particular team, subscribe to `/teams/{team-id}/members`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamMember.Read.All, TeamMember.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamMember.Read.Group*, TeamMember.Read.All, TeamMember.ReadWrite.All   |

>**Note:** Permissions marked with * are supported as part of [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{team-id}/members",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",
  "encryptionCertificateId": "{customId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```

## Subscribe to membership changes in all private channels of a particular team

To get change notifications for membership changes in all private channels in a particular team, subscribe to `/teams/{team-id}/channels/getAllMembers`. This resource supports [including resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md) in the notification.

[!INCLUDE [teams-model-A-and-B-disclaimer](../includes/teams-model-A-and-B-disclaimer.md)]

### Permissions

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Not supported. |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelMember.Read.All   |


### Example

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created,deleted,updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.azurewebsites.net/api/resourceNotifications",
  "resource": "/teams/{team-id}/channels/getAllMembers",
  "includeResourceData": true,
  "encryptionCertificate": "{base64encodedCertificate}",

  "expirationDateTime": "2019-09-19T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "{secretClientState}"
}
```




### Notifications with resource data

For notifications with resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a membership change in a team.

```json
{
    "value": [{
        "subscriptionId": "10493aa0-4d29-4df5-bc0c-ef742cc6cd7f",
        "changeType": "created",
        "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
        "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T10:30:34.9097561-08:00",
        "resource": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')",
        "resourceData": {
            "id": "ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=",
            "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.aadUserConversationMember",
            "@odata.id": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')"
        },
        "encryptedContent": {
            "data": "<<--EncryptedContent-->",
            "dataKey": "<<--EnryptedDataKeyUsedForEncryptingContent-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateId": "<<--IdOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>",
            "encryptionCertificateThumbprint": "<<--ThumbprintOfTheCertificateUsedForEncryptingDataKey-->>"
        },
        "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>"
    }],
    "validationTokens": ["<<--ValidationTokens-->>"]
}
```

The payload for the channel membership events is similar to the previous payload except that the **resource** property points to a channel member instead of a team member.

For details about how to validate tokens and decrypt the payload, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](webhooks-with-resource-data.md).

The decrypted notification payload looks like the following. The payload conforms to the [aaduserconversationmember](/graph/api/resources/aaduserconversationmember?preserve-view=true) schema. The payload is similar to that returned by GET operations.

```json
{
  "id": "/ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=",
  "roles": [
    "owner"
  ],
  "displayName": "John Doe",
  "userId": "8b081ef6-4792-4def-b2c9-c363a1bf41d5",
  "email": null
}
```

### Notifications without resource data

Notifications without resource data give you enough information to make GET calls to get the message content. Subscriptions for notifications without resource data don't require an encryption certificate (because actual resource data is not sent over).

For notifications without resource data, the payload looks like the following. This payload is for a membership change in a team.

```json
{
  "subscriptionId": "9f9d1ed0-c9cc-42e7-8d80-a7fc4b0cda3c",
  "changeType": "created",
  "tenantId": "<<--TenantForWhichNotificationWasSent-->>",
  "clientState": "<<--SpecifiedClientState-->>",
  "subscriptionExpirationDateTime": "2021-02-02T11:26:41.0537895-08:00",
  "resource": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')",
  "resourceData": {
    "id": "ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk",
    "@odata.type": "#Microsoft.Graph.aadUserConversationMember",
    "@odata.id": "teams('ee0f5ae2-8bc6-4ae5-8466-7daeebbfa062')/members('ZWUwZjVhZTItOGJjNi00YWU1LTg0NjYtN2RhZWViYmZhMDYyIyM3Mzc2MWYwNi0yYWM5LTQ2OWMtOWYxMC0yNzlhOGNjMjY3Zjk=')"
  }
}
```

The payload for the channel membership events is similar to the previous payload except that the **resource** property points to a channel member instead of a team member.

The **resource** and **@odata.id** properties can be used to make calls to Microsoft Graph to get the payload for the message. GET calls will always return the current state of the message. If the message is changed between when the notification is sent and when the message is retrieved, the operation will return the updated message.
