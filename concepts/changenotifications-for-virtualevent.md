# Get change notifications for Microsoft Teams virtual event updates

Change notifications in Microsoft Graph support subscriptions to virtual events. Change notifications provide a low-latency model by allowing you to maintain a webhook to Microsoft Teams virtual events. Virtual event subscriptions have a maximum period of a day. To extend the lifetime of a subscription, the subscription must be renewed before the expiry period. Alternatively, a user might decide to create a new subscription for the resource after the expiry of an existing subscription. For more details, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API to get change notifications](/graph/api/resources/webhooks).

## Subscribe to all events created in a tenant

You can specify subscriptions for all events of a unique app and tenant in the subscription payload by using the following syntax: `solutions/virtualEvents/events`. The subscription designates the notification URL to receive all event-created notifications in a tenant for virtual events. Only event-created notifications are supported for this subscription. A tenant can only have one type of subscription per application. User-delegated virtual event permissions are restricted from creating this type of subscription.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "resource": "solutions/virtualEvents/events",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-02-01T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "secretClientState"
}
```

## Subscribe to all events created in a tenant with relevant organizers

You can subscribe to all events that include any members of a set of organizers or coorganizers by using the following resource: 
`solutions/virtualEvents/events/getEventsFromOrganizers(organizerIds=['id1', 'id2'])`. These subscriptions receive any created notifications for all virtual events for a set of organizer or coorganizer IDs. This subscription is considered a subscription to all events created in a tenant. User-delegated virtual event permissions are restricted from creating this type of subscription.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "resource": "solutions/virtualEvents/events/getEventsFromOrganizers(organizerIds=['id1', 'id2'])",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-02-01T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "secretClientState"
}
```

## Subscribe to updated events of a specific webinar

To receive updated notifications for a particular webinar, you need to create a subscription for that unique webinar by using the following resource:  `solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}`.

An application can have only one subscription per webinar inside a tenant.
A user-delegated token allows you to set up one subscription for receiving webinar update notifications within a tenant, but the subscription is only available for users who have organized or co-organized webinars in the same tenant as the event host.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "resource": "solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-02-01T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "secretClientState"
}
```

## Subscribe to session event notifications for a webinar

To subscribe to notifications for sessions that are created or updated in a webinar, specify the resource as `solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}/sessions`.

An application can only have a single session level subscription per webinar in a tenant.
A user-delegated token allows you to set up one subscription for receiving webinar update notifications within a tenant, but the subscription is only available for users who have organized or co-organized webinars in the same tenant as the event host.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created, updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "resource": "solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}/sessions",
  "expirationDateTime": "2021-02-01T11:00:00.0000000Z",
  "clientState": "secretClientState"
}
```

## Subscribe to registration events for a webinar

To subscribe to notifications for registration events of a webinar, specify the resource as `solutions/virtualEvents/webinars/{webinarId}/registrations`.

An application can only have a single registration level subscription per webinar inside a tenant.
A user-delegated token allows you to set up one subscription for receiving webinar update notifications within a tenant, but the subscription is only available for users who have organized or co-organized webinars in the same tenant as the event host.

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "changeType": "created, updated",
  "notificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
  "lifecycleNotificationUrl": "https://webhook.contoso.com/api",
