# Microsoft Graph SDK overview

The Microsoft Graph SDKs are designed to simplify building high-quality, efficient, and resilient applications that access Microsoft Graph. The SDKs include two components: a service library and a core library.

The *service library* contains models and request builders that are generated from Microsoft Graph metadata to provide a rich, strongly typed, and discoverable experience when working with the many datasets available in Microsoft Graph.

The *core library* provides a set of features that enhance working with all the Microsoft Graph services. Embedded support for retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression improve the quality of your application's interactions with Microsoft Graph, with no added complexity, while leaving you completely in control. The core library also provides support for common tasks such as paging through collections and creating batch requests.

## Supported languages

SDKs are currently available for the following languages:

- [C#](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet)
- [PowerShell](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell)
- [TypeScript | JavaScript](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript)
- [Java](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-java)
- [Go](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-go)
- [PHP](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-php)
- [Python (preview)](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-python)


## SDKs in preview or GA status
A release of an SDK can be in _preview_ status upon debut or a significant update. Do not assume that a preview release will always be promoted to generally available (GA) status. 

In addition, do not use a preview release of an SDK in production apps, regardless of the version of Microsoft Graph API (v1.0 or beta) it uses.

A release of an SDK in _GA_ status can use the Microsoft Graph API v1.0 endpoint or beta endpoint as specified. Because Microsoft Graph APIs in the beta endpoint are subject to breaking changes, do not use in production apps a GA release of an SDK that accesses the Microsoft Graph API beta endpoint.


## Microsoft 365 developer subscription

When building applications using Microsoft Graph, we recommend that you get a free Microsoft 365 developer subscription by signing up for the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
