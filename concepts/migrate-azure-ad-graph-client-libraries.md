# Migrate .NET client library use to Microsoft Graph

This article is part of *step 3: review app details* of the [process to migrate apps](migrate-azure-ad-graph-planning-checklist.md).

If your app currently uses the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph client library, switch to the [Microsoft Graph .NET client library](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet).

>NOTE: The Microsoft Graph .NET client library is only supported for .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Standard 1.1.  However please consult Microsoft Graph .NET client library for the latest support information.

Here, we'll look at some general steps to migrate over to the Microsoft Graph .NET client library:

- How to create a Microsoft Graph client, given an access token (that you can acquire using either Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL) or Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL))
- How to formulate requests
- How to use query builders
- How to handle collections and paging  

## Overview of the migration steps

The following steps assume your app is already using ADAL to acquire access tokens to call Azure AD Graph, and that for now you will continue to use ADAL. Switching to MSAL can be done as a separate step described in [migrating to MSAL](./migrate-azure-ad-graph-authentication-library.md#migrating-to-msal).

1. To acquire an access token to Microsoft Graph, update **resourceUrl** from `https://graph.windows.net` to `https://graph.microsoft.com`.

2. In your app, update references to the Microsoft Graph client library by changing:

    ``` csharp
    using Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient;
    ```

    To:

    ``` csharp
    using Microsoft.Graph;
    ```

3. Use your package manager to download and update the [Microsoft Graph NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Graph/) and update dependencies.

4. Update your client constructor to create a `GraphServiceClient`, rather than `ActiveDirectoryClient`.  The following code snippets assume your app is using the `AcquireTokenAsyncForUser()` method to acquire new tokens. You can find a definition for this method as part of the [active-directory-dotnet-graphapi-console sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-graphapi-console/blob/archive/GraphConsoleAppV3/AuthenticationHelper.cs).

    Change:

    ``` csharp
    ActiveDirectoryClient client = new ActiveDirectoryClient(serviceRoot,
    async () => await AcquireTokenAsyncForUser());
    ```

    To:

    ``` csharp
    GraphServiceClient graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(serviceRoot,
       new DelegateAuthenticationProvider(async (requestMessage) => {
          var token = await AcquireTokenAsyncForUser();
          requestMessage.Headers.Authorization = new
             AuthenticationHeaderValue("bearer", token);
       }));
    ```

    For Microsoft Graph client library, the `serviceRoot` value also includes the version number. Currently, that value is `https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0`.

5. Update requests to use the Microsoft Graph client request builder syntax, by changing:

    ``` csharp
    signedInUser = (User)await client.Me.ExecuteAsync();
    ```

    To:

    ``` csharp
    signedInUser = (User)await client.Me.Request().GetAsync();
    ```

    >[!NOTE]
    >The Azure AD Graph client library supported LINQ-based query
    syntax. However, the Microsoft Graph client library does not.  Consequently, you'll need to convert the relevant queries to a more RESTful expression.  

    To do so, change:

    ``` csharp
    var groups = await
    client.Groups.Where(g => g.DisplayName.StartsWith("a")).ExecuteAsync();
    ```

    To:

    ``` csharp
    var groups = await
    client.Groups.Request().Filter("startswith(displayName,'a')").GetAsync();
    ```

6. If your code pages through collections, make the following minor adjustments. The following example compares and contrasts fetching a group and paging through its members, 5 at a time. While the code for Azure AD Graph requires a fetcher construct in order to fetch a group's members, Microsoft Graph has no such requirement. Other than that, the code is relatively similar.  To be concise, only user members are displayed, try/catch and error conditions are not shown, and the code snippets are for a single-threaded console app.

    As an example, change the following code using the Azure AD Graph .NET client library:

    ```csharp
    Group retrievedGroup = client.Groups.
        Where(g => g.ObjectId.Equals(id)).ExecuteAsync().Result;
    IGroupFetcher retrievedGroupFetcher = (IGroupFetcher) retrievedGroup;

    var membersPage = retrievedGroupFetcher.Members.Take(5).ExecuteAsync().Result;
    Console.WriteLine(" Members:");
    do
    {
        List<IDirectoryObject> members = membersPage.CurrentPage.ToList();
        foreach (IDirectoryObject member in members)
        {
            if (member is User)
            {
                User memberUser = (User)member;
                Console.WriteLine("        User: {0} ", memberUser.DisplayName);
            }
        }
        membersPage = membersPage.GetNextPageAsync().Result;
    } while (membersPage != null);

    ```

    To the following code using the Microsoft Graph .NET client library:

    ```csharp
    var membersPage = client.Groups[id].Members.Request().Top(5).GetAsync().Result;
    Console.WriteLine(" Members:");
    do
    {
        List<DirectoryObject> members = membersPage.CurrentPage.ToList();
        foreach (DirectoryObject member in members)
        {
            if (member is User)
            {
                User memberUser = (User)member;
                Console.WriteLine("        User: {0} ", memberUser.DisplayName);
            }
        }
        if (membersPage.NextPageRequest != null)
            membersPage = membersPage.NextPageRequest.GetAsync().Result;
        else membersPage = null;
    } while (membersPage != null);

    ```

7. Build and fix any resource, property, navigation, and service action errors, generally related to name changes.

The [C# console snippets app](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/console-csharp-snippets-sample) highlights more of the differences between Microsoft Graph client library and Azure AD Graph client library.

The Azure AD Graph client library supports only the .NET platform.  However, Microsoft Graph client library supports additional [platforms and languages](/graph) that you may find more useful for your solutions.
