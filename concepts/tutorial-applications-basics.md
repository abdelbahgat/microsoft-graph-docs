# Manage a Microsoft Entra application using Microsoft Graph

Your app must be registered in Microsoft Entra ID before the Microsoft identity platform can authorize it to access data stored in Microsoft Entra or Microsoft 365 tenants. This condition applies to apps that you develop yourself, that your tenant owns, or that you access through an active subscription.

Many settings for apps are recorded as objects that can be accessed, updated, or deleted using Microsoft Graph. In this article, you learn how to use Microsoft Graph to manage app and service principal objects including the properties, permissions, and role assignments.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:

+ A working Microsoft Entra tenant.
+ Sign in to [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge) as a user with privileges allowed to create and manage applications in the tenant.

<a name='register-an-application-with-azure-ad'></a>

## Register an application with Microsoft Entra ID

The following request creates an app by specifying only the required **displayName** property.

Least privilege delegated permission: `Application.ReadWrite.All`.

The request returns a `201 Created` response with the service principal object in the response body.

## Addressing an application or a service principal object

You can address an application or a service principal by its ID or by its **appId**, where ID is referred to as *Object ID* and **appId** is referred to as *Application (client) ID* on the Microsoft Entra admin center. These syntaxes are supported for all HTTP CRUD operations on applications and service principals.

To address an application or a service principal by its ID.

```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/{applicationObjectId}
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipalObjectId}
```

To address an application or a service principal by its **appId**.
```http
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications(appId='appId')
https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/servicePrincipals(appId='appId')
```

## Configure other basic properties for your app

Least privilege delegated permission: `Application.ReadWrite.All`.

You configure the following basic properties for the app.

+ Add tags for categorization in the organization. Also, use the `HideApp` tag to hide the app from My Apps and the Microsoft 365 Launcher.
+ Add basic information including the logo, terms of service, and privacy statement.
+ Store contact information about the application

## Assign permissions to an app

While you can assign permissions to an app through the Microsoft Entra admin center, you also assign permissions through Microsoft Graph by updating the **requiredResourceAccess** property of the app object. You must pass in both existing and new permissions. Passing in only new permissions overwrites and removes the existing permissions that haven't yet been consented to.

Assigning permissions doesn't automatically grant them to the app. You must still grant admin consent using the Microsoft Entra admin center. To grant permissions without interactive consent, see [Grant or revoke API permissions programmatically](permissions-grant-via-msgraph.md).

Least privilege delegated permission: `Application.ReadWrite.All`.

## Lock sensitive properties for service principals

The *app instance lock* feature allows you to protect sensitive properties of your multi-tenant apps from unauthorized tampering. The following properties of the service principal object can be locked:

- **keyCredentials** where the usage type is `Sign` or `Verify`.
- **passwordCredentials** where the usage type is `Sign` or `Verify`.
- **tokenEncryptionKeyId** property.

You manage the app instance lock feature through the **servicePrincipalLockConfiguration** property of the [application](/graph/api/resources/application) object of the multi-tenant app.

#### To lock all sensitive properties of a service principal

When **isEnabled** and **allProperties** is set to `true`, even if other properties of the servicePrincipalLockConfiguration object are `null`, then all sensitive properties of the service principal are locked.

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/a0b7f39e-3139-48aa-9397-f46fb63102f7

{
    "servicePrincipalLockConfiguration": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "allProperties": true
    }
}
```

#### To lock specific sensitive properties of a service principal

The following example locks the **keyCredentials** and **passwordCredentials** properties of the service principal and enables the app instance lock feature.

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/applications/a0b7f39e-3139-48aa-9397-f46fb63102f7

{
    "servicePrincipalLockConfiguration": {
        "isEnabled": true,
        "credentialsWithUsageSign": true,
        "credentialsWithUsageVerify": true
    }
}
```
