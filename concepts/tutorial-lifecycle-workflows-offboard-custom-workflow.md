# Complete employee offboarding tasks in real-time on their last day of work using Lifecycle Workflows APIs

This tutorial provides step-by-step guidance for completing a real-time employee termination with Lifecycle Workflows using Microsoft Graph.

This post off-boarding scenario will run a workflow on-demand and accomplish the following tasks:

1. Remove all licenses for user
2. Remove user from all Teams
3. Delete user account

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following resources and privileges:

+ The tenant you want to use to preview the Lifecycle Workflows feature with an Azure AD Premium P2 license enabled.
+ Sign in to an API client such as [Graph Explorer](https://aka.ms/ge), Postman, or create your own client app to call Microsoft Graph. To call Microsoft Graph APIs in this tutorial, you need to use an account with the Lifecycle Administrator or Global Administrator Azure AD role.
+ Grant yourself the following *LifecycleWorkflows.ReadWrite.All* delegated permission.
+ Create a test user account that you'll use to represent an employee leaving your organization. This test user account will be deleted when the workflow runs. Assign licenses and Teams memberships to the test user account.

## Create a "leaver" workflow

### Request

The following request creates an offboarding workflow with the following settings:

+ It can be run on-demand but not on schedule.
+ The workflow doesn't include execution conditions. Execution conditions, even when defined, are bypassed for workflows that are run on-demand.
+ Three workflow tasks are enabled to run in sequence: the user is removed from all groups, then removed from all teams, then their user account is deleted.
