## Create a Microsoft Entra app

Microsoft Graph, the API that you use to connect to Microsoft 365, is secured with OAuth 2.0. In order to connect your app to Microsoft 365, you'll need to create an app in Microsoft Entra ID and grant this app permission to access specific resources on behalf of the person using your app.

Follow the steps in the [Create a Microsoft Entra app](../get-started/add-aad-app-registration.md) article to create a new Microsoft Entra app.
