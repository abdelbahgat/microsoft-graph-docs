## Create an Azure Active Directory app

Microsoft Graph, the API that you use to connect to Microsoft 365, is secured with OAuth 2.0. In order to connect your app to Microsoft 365, you will need to create an app in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and grant this app permissions to access specific resources on behalf of the person using your app.

Follow the steps in the [Create an Azure Active Directory app](../get-started/add-aad-app-registration.md) article to create a new Azure AD app.
