Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of web components and authentication providers for connecting apps to Microsoft 365 data and intelligence.

## How does the sample work?

This sample creates a web app that consumes the Microsoft Graph Toolkit MSAL2 provider to enable authentication through Azure Active Directory and uses UI components to render calendar events, to-do tasks, and files that will look and feel like native Microsoft experiences.
