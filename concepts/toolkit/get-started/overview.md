# Get started with Microsoft Graph Toolkit

Microsoft Graph Toolkit components can easily be added to your web application, SharePoint web part, or Microsoft Teams tabs. The components are based on web standards and can be used in both plain JavaScript projects or with popular web frameworks such as Reach, Angular, and Vue.js.

Watch this short video to get started using the toolkit.

For a step-by-step tutorial, see the [Get started with Microsoft Graph Toolkit](/training/modules/msgraph-toolkit-intro/) module.

## Set up your Microsoft 365 tenant

To use Microsoft Graph Toolkit to develop an app, you need access to a Microsoft 365 tenant. If you don't have one, you can get a free Microsoft 365 developer subscription by [joining the Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program). For details about how to configure your subscription, see [Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription](/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-get-started).

## Set up your development environment

To develop with the toolkit, you need:

- A text editor or IDE. You can use the editor or IDE of your choice, or you can install and use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for free.
- A modern web browser such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Firefox.
- An LTS version of Node.js, which you can install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

## Use Microsoft Graph Toolkit

You can use Microsoft Graph Toolkit in your application by referencing the loader directly (via `unpkg`) or by installing the `npm` package.

# [unpkg](#tab/html)

To use the toolkit via `mgt-loader`, add the reference in a script to your code:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@microsoft/mgt@3/dist/bundle/mgt-loader.js"></script>

<mgt-msal2-provider client-id="<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>"></mgt-msal2-provider>
<mgt-login></mgt-login>
```

# [package](#tab/package)

Using the toolkit via ES6 modules gives you full control of the bundling process and allows you to bundle only the code that you need for your application. To use the ES6 modules, add the package to your project:

```cmd
npm install @microsoft/mgt
```

Now you can reference all the components on the page that you're using:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="node_modules/@microsoft/mgt/dist/es6/index.js"
></script>

<mgt-login></mgt-login>
<mgt-agenda></mgt-agenda>
```

### Packages

Microsoft Graph Toolkit is made up of several packages, allowing you to only include the code that you need for your applications.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-element</b>

The `@microsoft/mgt-element` is the core package that contains only the base classes used for building components and providers. This package exposes all the necessary classes and interfaces that you need to build your own components, and exports the [`IProvider` interface and SimpleProvider class](../providers/custom.md) for building custom providers.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-components</b>

The `@microsoft/mgt-components` package contains all the Microsoft Graph connected web components, such as `Person`, `PeoplePicker`, and more.

**Providers**

Providers are available via a single package and can be installed as needed. The following provider packages are available:

- <b>@microsoft/mgt-msal2-provider</b>

  <code>[@microsoft/mgt-msal2-provider](../providers/msal2.md)</code> contains the `Msal2Provider` and `mgt-msal2-provider` component. The MSAL2 provider uses MSAL-browser for authenticating in web apps and PWAs.

- <b>@microsoft/mgt-sharepoint-provider</b>

  <code>[@microsoft/mgt-sharepoint-provider](../providers/sharepoint.md)</code> contains the `SharePointProvider` for authenticating in a SharePoint environment.

- <b>@microsoft/mgt-proxy-provider</b>

  <code>[@microsoft/mgt-proxy-provider](../providers/proxy.md)</code> contains the `ProxyProvider` for an application that proxy Graph calls through a backend service.

<b>@microsoft/mgt</b>

The `@microsoft/mgt` package is the main package that includes all the preceding packages and re-exports them so they're available via a single package that you can install.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-react</b>

The <code>[@microsoft/mgt-react](./mgt-react.md)</code> package contains all the autogenerated React components and takes dependency on the `@microsoft/mgt` package.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-chat</b>

The <code>[@microsoft/mgt-chat](./mgt-react.md)</code> package contains all the chat React components and takes dependency on the `@microsoft/mgt-react` package.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-spfx</b>

The <code>[@microsoft/mgt-spfx](./mgt-spfx.md)</code> package contains a SharePoint Framework library to use Microsoft Graph Toolkit in SharePoint Framework solutions.

<b>@microsoft/mgt-spfx-utils</b>

The <code>@microsoft/mgt-spfx-utils</code> package contains a helper function to assist with lazy loading for [disambiguation](../customize-components/disambiguation.md#usage-in-sharepoint-framework-web-parts-with-react) when using Microsoft Graph Toolkit in SharePoint Framework solutions.
