# Enable the simplified admin experience for your Microsoft Graph connector in the Teams admin center

This article describes how to enable the simplified admin experience for your Microsoft Graph connector in the Teams admin center. When you enable this experience, Teams admins and Global admins can enable or disable your custom Microsoft Graph connector seamlessly in the Teams admin center.

![simplified admin experience in the Teams admin center](images/connectors-images/oneclickadmin-TAC-connectors.png)

To enable the simplified admin experience in the Teams admin center:
1. Update the Teams app manifest.
2. Update Microsoft Graph permissions.
3. Handle Microsoft Graph webhook notifications.
4. Create or delete Microsoft Graph connections.
5. Validate the experience by enabling the Microsoft Graph Connector in the Teams admin center.

## Update the Teams app manifest
In the Teams app manifest, at the root, at the same level as properties like **name**, **description**, and **icons**, add the **graphConnector** property (introduced in [v1.11](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json) of the app manifest) with a **notificationUrl**. This field contains the URL to which Microsoft Graph connector notifications for the application are sent. The app manifest version must be [v1.13](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/json-schemas/teams/v1.13/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json) or higher for the simplified admin experience to work.

Ensure that the **webApplicationInfo** property is added to the manifest. After you update the manifest, upload it by sideloading the app or publishing the app to the store.

```JSON
{
 "$schema":"https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/teams/v1.11/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json",
  "manifestVersion": "1.11",
  ...
  "webApplicationInfo": {
    "id": "<AAD_APP_ID>",  // e.g. "7e47846e-4bef-4c42-9817-a14e92287f28"
    "resource": "<AAD_APP_RESOURCE>" // e.g. "api://xmngc.loca.lt/7e47846e-4bef-4c42-9817-a14e92287f28"

  },
  "graphConnector": {
    "notificationUrl": "<AAD_APP_NOTIFICATION_URL>"
  }
}
```

## Update Microsoft Graph permissions
In the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com) > expand the **Identity** menu > select **Applications** > **App registrations** > select your app registration > select **API permissions** > select **Add a permission** > select **Microsoft Graph**. Select the `ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` and `ExternalItem.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` Microsoft Graph permissions as shown in the following example.

## Handle Microsoft Graph webhook notifications
When the admin turns **on** or **off** the Microsoft Graph connector from the Teams admin center, Microsoft Graph sends a change notification to the URL specified in the **notificationUrl** property in the manifest. Your app needs to manage these Microsoft Graph connections accordingly.

### Change notifications
For details about how to set up change notifications, see [Set up notifications for changes in resource data](/graph/webhooks#change-notifications). The following is an example of a payload.

![Payload example for Microsoft Graph webhook notification](images/connectors-images/samplepayload-webhooknotif-TAC.png)

To understand how to validate the inbound change notification, see [Validating the authenticity of notifications](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data#validating-the-authenticity-of-notifications).

Keep the following tips in mind:
* You can ignore **SubscriptionExpirationDateTime** and **SubscriptionId**.
* The change notification is for Microsoft Graph connector management only when the @odata.type of the resource data matches the one in the sample payload.
* The **tenantId** identified is the customer's tenant ID. When calling the Microsoft Graph API to [manage Microsoft Graph connections](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-connections), you must generate the app token on behalf of this customer's tenant ID.
* Within **resourceData**, use **state** to determine whether to create or delete connections. **connectorsTicket** are needed when creating the connections.

### Handling "connector enable" notification

To handle "connector enable" notifications:

* Determine which Microsoft Graph connections to create (how many connections and which schema for each connection) by using the [External connection List API](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-list?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true&tabs=http) to query for all connections. Determine whether to create all connections from scratch, resume creation of connections (in resiliency flow), or no-op (when all desired connections are already in the **ready** state).
* The [connection](/graph/api/externalconnectors-external-post-connections) is created in a **draft** state. Pass the **connectorsTicket** opaque encoded string to the connection creation API in the `GraphConnectors-Ticket` HTTP header.
* [Register the schema](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-patch-schema?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true&tabs=http).
* After a successful schema creation or update, the connection should reach a **ready** state.

### Handling "connector disable" notification

To handle "connector disable" notifications:

* Determine which Microsoft Graph connections to delete by using the [External connection List API](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-list) to query for all connections.
* Delete all connections by using the [External connection Delete API](/graph/api/externalconnectors-externalconnection-delete?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true&tabs=http).
* We recommend that you build resiliency logic to retry the deleted connection to verify that it is deleted.

}
```

#### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Content-type: application/json

```
You need to send a `202 - Accepted` status code in your response to Microsoft Graph. If Microsoft Graph doesn't receive a 2xx class code, it will try to publish the change notification a number of times for a period of about 4 hours. After that, the change notification will be dropped and won't be delivered.

>[!NOTE]
>Send the `202 - Accepted` status code as soon as you receive the change notification, even before you validate its authenticity. You are acknowledging the receipt of the change notification and preventing unnecessary retries.
>The current timeout is 30 seconds, but it might be reduced in the future to optimize service performance.
>If the notification URL doesn't reply within 30 seconds for more than 10% of the requests from Microsoft Graph over a 10-minute period, all subsequent notifications will be delayed and retried for a period of 4 hours.
>If a notification URL doesn't reply within 30 seconds for more than 20% of the requests from Microsoft Graph over a 10-minute period, all subsequent notifications will be dropped.

To validate the authenticity of **validatonToken**:
- Verify that the token has not expired.
- Verify that the token has not been tampered with and was issued by the Microsoft identity platform.
- Verify that the **appId** claim in the **validationToken** is 0bf30f3b-4a52-48df-9a82-234910c4a086.
- Verify the **aud** claim in the **validationToken** is the same as the "{{Teams-appid}}" you specified.

For details, see [Validating the authenticity of notification](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data?tabs=csharp#validating-the-authenticity-of-notifications).

The following example shows a validation token.
```

```

## Create or delete Microsoft Graph connections
You will need to send the **connectorTickets** from the payload you received as a `GraphConnectors-Ticket` header while initiating the creation of the Teams app connection, as shown in the following example.

### Request
```
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/external/connection
GraphConnectors-Ticket: {{connectorsTicket}}
Content-type: application/json
Authorization: bearer {{accessToken}}

{
    "id": "{{connectionId}}",
    "name": "Contoso HR",
    "description": "Connection to index Contoso HR system",
    "connectorId": "{{connectorId}}",
    "enabledContentExperiences": "MicrosoftSearch, Compliance, …",
    "searchSettings": { … },
    "complianceSettings": { … },
    …
}
```

>[!NOTE]
>- {{connectorId}} is the value of the **id** property in the manifest. For details, see [App manifest schema for Teams](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema).
>- You should acquire the {{accessToken}} from the [Microsoft identity platform](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-app-types) for the tenant that is being notified.

### Response
```
HTTP/1.1 200 Accepted
Content-type: application/json
Content-length: 0
```

>[!NOTE]
>Various Microsoft 365 experiences can be enabled for the connections created. For details, see [Microsoft Graph connectors overview](/graph/connecting-external-content-connectors-overview).

To learn how to ingest external items into a working Microsoft Graph connection, see [Create, update, and delete items added by your application via Microsoft Graph connectors](/graph/connecting-external-content-manage-items).

## Validate the experience by enabling the Microsoft Graph connector in the Teams admin center

To validate the experience:
* Sign in to the [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com) as a Teams admin or Global admin of the tenant.
* Select the **Manage apps** blade in the left rail.
* Go to your Teams application.
* On the detail page of the Teams app, you will notice a new **Graph Connector** tab that allows an admin to enable or disable the Microsoft Graph connector.
* Select the toggle button to send the enable or disable notifications to the notification endpoint of the app, as specified by the **graphConnector.notificationUrl** property in the app manifest.

## Make your Microsoft Graph connector available for other organizations in the Teams admin center

You can submit your Microsoft Graph connector packaged as a Teams app extended across Microsoft 365 to [Microsoft Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/). This will allow Microsoft to validate your Microsoft Graph connector, so that other organizations can discover and deploy it in the [Microsoft Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com).

You can use the [step-by-step submission guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/marketplace/add-in-submission-guide) to learn how to submit your app. Make sure that you submit a **Teams app** in the **Microsoft 365 and Copilot** tab in **Marketplace offers**.

You will need to submit a PDF in the **Additional certification info** step. Microsoft will use the information you provide in this PDF to make sure that your Microsoft Graph connector performs as expected in Copilot for Microsoft 365. Your PDF must have the following sections:
- Demo Tenant User Name
- Custom Vertical Name
- Semantic Labels
- Sample Prompts
- Connection Description
- Activity Settings

### Demo Tenant User Name

Create a user account on your demo tenant that Microsoft can use to validate your Microsoft Graph connector. This can be done in the [Users section](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/users/:/adduser) of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. 
Ensure that this new user account has a Copilot for Microsoft 365 license, and the password is sent to **microsoftgraphconnectorappvalidation@service.microsoft.com**. 

In this section of the PDF, provide the username for this new user account. It is mandatory to provide this username.

After Microsoft validates your app, you can revoke access to the user account.

### Custom Vertical Name

Create a custom vertical that only returns results from your custom Microsoft Graph connector. Do this in the [Verticals section](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MicrosoftSearch/verticals) of the **Customization** tab of the Search & Intelligence Portal.
In this section of the PDF, provide the name of this custom vertical. A name for the custom vertical is mandatory.

### Semantic Labels

In the Semantic Labels section, indicate which properties from your connection schema have the `title`, `url`, and `iconUrl` semantic labels. This schema mapping is mandatory.

### Sample Prompts

In the Sample Prompts section, provide two sample prompts that Microsoft can use to validate your Microsoft Graph connector in Copilot for Microsoft 365. These prompts should include at least a partial match to the `title` semantic label. These prompts are mandatory.

### Connection Description

In Connection Description section, provide the `description` property for your custom Microsoft Graph connection. Microsoft will use this to ensure that your Microsoft Graph connection has a rich description for Copilot for Microsfot 365. This description is optional.

### Activity Settings

In the Activity Settings section, provide the activity settings for your Microsoft Graph connection with a `urlToItemResolvers` resource. The activity settings are optional but we highly recommend that you provide them.
