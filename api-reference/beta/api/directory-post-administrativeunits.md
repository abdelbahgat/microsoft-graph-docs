# Create administrativeUnit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to create a new [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md).
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All |

To create an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits
POST /directory/administrativeUnits
```
## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating an **administrativeUnit**.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit. Optional. |
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. Required. |
| membershipRule | String | Dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more about the rules that you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Using attributes to create advanced rules](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-accessmanagement-groups-with-advanced-rules/). Optional. |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Used to control whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` when you want the dynamic membership rule to be active and `Paused` if you want to stop updating membership dynamically. Optional. |
| membershipType | String | Membership type for the administrative unit. Can be `dynamic` or `assigned`. Optional. |
| visibility |String | Visibility for the administrative unit. If not set, then the default is `public`. Can be set to `HiddenMembership`, which hides the membership from non-members. Optional. |

Because the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the administrative unit while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object in the response body.
