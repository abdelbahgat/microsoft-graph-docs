# Create administrativeUnit

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to create a new [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).


<!-- { "blockType": "permissions", "name": "directory_post_administrativeunits" } -->
[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/directory-post-administrativeunits-permissions.md)]

To create an administrative unit, the calling principal must be assigned one of the following [Microsoft Entra roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json):

* Privileged Role Administrator
* Global Administrator

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /administrativeUnits
POST /directory/administrativeUnits
```
## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object.

You can specify the following properties when creating an **administrativeUnit**.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| description | String | Description for the administrative unit. Optional. |
| displayName | String | Display name for the administrative unit. Required. |
| isMemberManagementRestricted | Boolean | `true` if members of this administrative unit should be treated as sensitive, which requires specific permissions to manage. Default value is `false`. Use this property to define administrative units whose roles don't inherit from tenant-level administrators, and management of individual member objects is limited to administrators scoped to a restricted management administrative unit. Immutable, so can't be changed later. Optional. |
| membershipRule | String | Dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more about the rules that you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Using attributes to create advanced rules](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-accessmanagement-groups-with-advanced-rules/). Optional. |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Used to control whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` when you want the dynamic membership rule to be active and `Paused` if you want to stop updating membership dynamically. Optional. |
| membershipType | String | Membership type for the administrative unit. Can be `dynamic` or `assigned`. Optional. |
| visibility |String | Visibility for the administrative unit. If not set, then the default is `public`. Can be set to `HiddenMembership`, which hides the membership from non-members. Optional. |

Because the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the administrative unit while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [administrativeUnit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an administrative unit

The following example creates a new administrative unit with a dynamic membership rule to include all users whose country is United States.
