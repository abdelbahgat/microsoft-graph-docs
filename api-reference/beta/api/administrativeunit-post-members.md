### Adding an existing user or group
In the request body, provide the `id` of a [user](../resources/user.md),  [group](../resources/group.md), [device](../resources/device.md), or [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) to be added.

### Creating a new group
The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource to specify when you create a group in the administrative unit.

| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. Required. |

## Response

If successful, adding an existing object (using `$ref`) returns `204 No Content` response code. It does not return anything in the response body. 

When creating a new group (without `$ref`), this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.
