# List accessPackageAssignmentRequests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

In [Azure AD entitlement management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), retrieve a list of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects.  The resulting list includes all the assignment requests, current and well as expired, that the caller has access to read, across all catalogs and access packages.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.Read.All, EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/accessPackageAssignmentRequests
```

## Query parameters

This method supports the `$select`, `$expand` and `$filter` OData query parameters to help customize the response.

If the user or application only has permissions within a specific catalog or catalogs, you must include in the query a filter which specifies an access package, such as `$expand=accessPackage&$filter=accessPackage/id eq '9bbe5f7d-f1e7-4eb1-a586-38cdf6f8b1ea'`.

### Example scenarios for using query parameters

- To retrieve the access package of each request, include `$expand=accessPackage` in the query. 
- To retrieve the resulting assignment, include `$expand=accessPackageAssignment` in the query. 
- To obtain more details on the requestor, include `$expand=requestor` in the query.

For general information, see [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters).

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) objects in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

The following is an example of the request. The request URI includes `$filter` to only return requests in a particular state, and `$expand` to return details of the requestor and their connected organization as well.
