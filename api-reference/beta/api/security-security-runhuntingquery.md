# security: runHuntingQuery
Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Queries a specified set of event, activity, or entity data supported by Microsoft 365 Defender to proactively look for specific threats in your environment.

This is the method for advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender. This method includes a query in Kusto Query Language (KQL). It specifies a data table in the [advanced hunting schema](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-schema-tables?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) and a piped sequence of operators to filter or search that data, and format the query output in specific ways. 

Find out more about [hunting for threats across devices, emails, apps, and identities](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-query-emails-devices?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). Learn about [KQL](/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/).

For information on using advanced hunting in the [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-defender-portal?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true), see [Proactively hunt for threats with advanced hunting in Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-overview?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true).

### Request

This example specifies a KQL query which does the following:
- Looks into the [DeviceProcessEvents](/microsoft-365/security/defender/advanced-hunting-deviceprocessevents-table?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true) table in the advanced hunting schema.
- Filters on the condition that the event is initiated by the powershell.exe process.
- Specifies the output of 3 columns from the same table for each row: `Timestamp`, `FileName`, `InitiatingProcessFileName`.
- Sorts the output by the `Timestamp` value.
- Limits the output to 2 records (2 rows).
