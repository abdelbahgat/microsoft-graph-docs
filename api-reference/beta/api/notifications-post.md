# Create and send a notification

Namespace: microsoft.graph
[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create and send a notification targeting a user through Microsoft Graph. The notification is stored in the Microsoft Graph notification feed store, and is sent to all app clients on all device endpoints that the user is signed in to.  

## Permissions
Your application service does not require any additional permissions to post notifications to your targeted user.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you choose to post notifications on behalf of a user via delegated permissions instead, one of the following permissions is required to call this API. We don't recommend this option for creating notifications. If you'd like to learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Notifications.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Notifications.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp    |
|Application | Not supported.|



## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /me/notifications/
```
## Request headers
|Name | Description|
|:----|:-----------|
|Authorization | The authorization header is used to pass the credentials of the calling party. Bearer {token}. Required. |
|X-UNS-ID | The UserNotificationSubscriptionId that is returned by the Microsoft Graph notification service after creating a subscription and is used to target the specific user. Required. |

## Request body
