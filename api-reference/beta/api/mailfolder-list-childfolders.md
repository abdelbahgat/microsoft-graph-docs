# List childFolders

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the folder collection under the specified folder. You can use the `.../me/mailFolders` shortcut to get the top-level
folder collection and navigate to another folder.

By default, this operation does not return hidden folders. Use a query parameter _includeHiddenFolders_ to include them in the response.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite           |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite           |
| Application                            | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite           |

## HTTP request

To get all the child folders under the specified folder, excluding those that are hidden:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders
```

To include _hidden_ child folders in the response:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders?includeHiddenFolders=true
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders?includeHiddenFolders=true
```

## Optional query parameters
To return a list of all childFolders including those that are hidden (their **isHidden** property is true), in the request URL, specify the `includeHiddenFolders` query parameter as `true`, as shown in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section.

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

## Request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description               |
|:--------------|:-------|:--------------------------|
| Authorization | string | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) objects in the response body.
