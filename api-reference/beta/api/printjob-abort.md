# printJob: abort

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Abort a print job. Only applications using application permissions can abort a print job.

Aborting a print job will only succeed if there is a [printTask](../resources/printTask.md) in a `processing` state on the associated print job, started by a trigger that the requesting app created. For details about how to register a task trigger, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).
