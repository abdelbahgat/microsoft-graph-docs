# driveItem: createLink

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

You can use **createLink** action to share a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) via a sharing link.

The **createLink** action will create a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, the existing sharing link will be returned.

DriveItem resources inherit sharing permissions from their ancestors.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |

## Examples

### Example 1: Create an anonymous sharing link
The following example requests a sharing link to be created for the **driveItem** specified by {itemId} in the user's OneDrive.
The sharing link is configured to be read-only and usable by anyone with the link.

### Example 2: Creating company sharable links

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support company sharable links.
These are similar to anonymous links, except they only work for members of the owning organization.
To create a company sharable link, use the **scope** parameter with a value of `organization`.

  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "create-link-scoped",
  "scopes": "files.readwrite service.sharepoint",
  "sampleKeys": ["01G7ZEPNWQ6DTNTJHHJFBYZD47OAVFOO46"]
 } -->

```http
POST /me/drive/items/{item-id}/createLink

    },
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Creating embeddable links

When using the `embed` link type, the webUrl returned can be embedded in an `<iframe>` HTML element.
When an embed link is created the `webHtml` property contains the HTML code for an `<iframe>` to host the content.

>**Note:** Embed links are only supported for OneDrive personal.

## Remarks

* To create a link based on the organization's default policy and the caller's permissions on the **driveItem**, omit the scope and type parameters
* Links created using this action do not expire unless a default expiration policy is enforced for the organization.
* Links are visible in the sharing permissions for the **driveItem** and can be removed by an owner of the **driveItem**.
* Links always point to the current version of a **driveItem** unless the **driveItem** is checked out (SharePoint only).
