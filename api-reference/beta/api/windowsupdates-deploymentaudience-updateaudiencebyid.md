# deploymentAudience: updateAudienceById

Namespace: microsoft.graph.windowsUpdates

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the members and exclusions collections of a [deploymentAudience](../resources/windowsupdates-deploymentaudience.md) with [updatableAsset](../resources/windowsupdates-updatableasset.md) resources of the same type.

Adding an [azureADDevice](../resources/windowsupdates-azureaddevice.md) to the members or exclusions collections of a deployment audience automatically creates an Azure AD device object if it does not already exist.

If the same [updatableAsset](../resources/windowsupdates-updatableasset.md) gets included in the **exclusions** and **members** collections of a **deploymentAudience**, deployment will not apply to that asset.

You can also use the method [updateAudience](windowsupdates-deploymentaudience-updateaudience.md) to update the **deploymentAudience**.
