# List servicePrincipals

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a list of [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

> [!NOTE]
> A service principal can retrieve its own application and service principal details without being granted any application permissions.
> The *Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy* permission allows an app to call `GET /applications` and `GET /servicePrincipals` to list all applications and service principals in the tenant. This scope of access has been allowed for the permission.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 service principal objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

By default, this API doesn't return the value of the **key** in the **keyCredentials** property when listing all service principals. To retrieve the public key info in **key**, the **keyCredentials** property must be specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for service principals has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Request headers

| Name | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) objects in the response body.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal",

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "value": [
    {
      "accountEnabled":true,

      "signInAudience":"AzureADMyOrg"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Get only a count of service principals

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_count_only"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/servicePrincipals/$count
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain

893
```

### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one service principal with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
