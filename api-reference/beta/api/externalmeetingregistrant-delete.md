# Delete externalMeetingRegistrant

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The meeting organizer removes an [externalMeetingRegistrant](../resources/externalmeetingregistrant.md) from an online meeting which has [externalMeetingRegistration](../resources/externalmeetingregistration.md) enabled.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:----------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account) | OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application | OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All |

To use application permission for this API, tenant administrators must create an [application access policy](/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy) and grant it to a user to authorize the app configured in the policy to fetch online meetings and/or online meeting artifacts on behalf of that user (with user ID specified in the request path).

## HTTP request

To remove an external meeting registrant with delegated (`/me`) and app (`/users/{userId}/`) permission:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /me/onlineMeetings/{meetingId}/registration/registrants/{registrantId}
DELETE /users/{userId}/onlineMeetings/{meetingId}/registration/registrants/{registrantId}
```

> [!TIP]
>
> - `userId` is the **objectId** of the meeting organizer.
> - `meetingId` is the **id** of an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) object.
> - `registrantId` is the **id** of an [externalMeetingRegistrant](../resources/externalmeetingregistrant.md) object.
