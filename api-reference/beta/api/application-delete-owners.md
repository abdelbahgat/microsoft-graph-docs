# Remove owner

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Remove an owner from an [application](../resources/application.md). As a recommended best practice, apps should have at least two owners.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the application using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /applications/{id}/owners/{id}/$ref
DELETE /applications(appId='{appId}')/owners/{id}/$ref
```

> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the user who is the app owner, the user will also be deleted from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD); otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. You can restore deleted users through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).

## Request headers
| Name | Description|
|:---- |:---------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the identifier of the directory object to be assigned as owner.

## Response
