# Create educationModule

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [module](../resources/educationmodule.md) in a [class](../resources/educationclass.md).

Only teachers in a class can create a module. Modules start in the `draft` state, which means that students won't see the modules until publication.
