> [!IMPORTANT]

> - To update the following properties, you must specify them in their own PATCH request, without including the other properties listed in the table above: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.
>
> - Only a subset of the group API pertaining to core group administration and management support application and delegated permissions. All other members of the group API, including updating **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, support only delegated permissions. See [known issues](/graph/known-issues#groups) for examples.

### Manage extensions and associated data

Use this API to manage the [directory, schema, and open extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview) and their data for groups, as follows:

+ Add, update and store data in the extensions for an existing group.
+ For directory and schema extensions, remove any stored data by setting the value of the custom extension property to `null`. For open extensions, use the [Delete open extension](/graph/api/opentypeextension-delete) API.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response codeâ€”except a `200 OK` response code when updating the following properties: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.
