# List members of team
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the [conversationMember](../resources/conversationmember.md) collection of a [team](../resources/team.md).

In the future, membership results may include users from various tenants, as indicated in the response. Clients should avoid assuming that all members exclusively belong to the current tenant.

> [!NOTE] 
> This API results in a 401 error when a newly created tenant calls this method. For more information, see [Known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=19164).
