## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand`, `$select`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$orderby` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Drive](../resources/drive.md) objects in the response body.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", 
       "@odata.type": "Collection(microsoft.graph.drive)",
       "name": ["group-list-drives", "site-list-drives", "user-list-drives", "enum-drives"],
       "truncated": true } -->

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remarks

Most users will only have a single Drive resource.

Groups and Sites may have multiple Drive resources available.

Drives with the [system][] facet are hidden by default.
To list them, include `system` in your `$select` statement.

[system]: ../resources/systemfacet.md
