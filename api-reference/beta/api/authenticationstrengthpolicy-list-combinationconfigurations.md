# List combinationConfigurations
Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the [authenticationCombinationConfiguration](../resources/authenticationcombinationconfiguration.md) objects for an [authentication strength policy](../resources/authenticationstrengthpolicy.md). authenticationCombinationConfiguration represents requirements placed on specific authentication method combinations that require specified variants of those authentication methods to be used when authenticating. Currently, only [fido2combinationConfigurations](../resources/fido2combinationconfiguration.md) objects are supported.

authenticationCombinationConfiguration objects are supported only for custom authentication strengths.
