# Send mail

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Send the message specified in the request body using either JSON or MIME format.

When using JSON format you can include an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) and use a [mention](../resources/mention.md) to call out another user in the new message.

When using MIME format:
- Provide the applicable [Internet message headers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2076) and the [MIME content](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045), all encoded in **base64** format in the request body.
- Add any attachments and S/MIME properties to the MIME content.

This method saves the message in the **Sent Items** folder.

Alternatively, [create a draft message](../api/user-post-messages.md) to send later.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions are required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

```

|Message|[Message](../resources/message.md)|The message to send. Required.|
|SaveToSentItems|Boolean|Indicates whether to save the message in Sent Items. Specify it only if the parameter is false; default is true.  Optional.|

To use **mention** to call out another user in the new message:
- Include the required **toRecipients** property, the **mentions** property, and any writable message properties in the request body.
- For each mention in the **mentions** property, you must specify the **mentioned** property.

When specifying the body in MIME format, provide the MIME content as **a base64-encoded string** in the request body. Do not include parameters.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `202 Accepted` response code. It does not return anything in the response body.

If the request body includes malformed MIME content, this method returns `400 Bad request` and the following error message: "Invalid base64 string for MIME content".
