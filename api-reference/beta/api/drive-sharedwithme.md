# List items shared with the signed-in user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve a collection of [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resources that have been shared with the owner of the [Drive](../resources/drive.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

**Note:** while the /sharedWithMe request will succeed with Files.Read or Files.ReadWrite permissions, some properties may be missing.
Additionally, without one of the  **All** permissions, shared items returned from this API will not be accessible.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /me/drive/sharedWithMe
```

## Response
If successful, this method returns a collection of [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resources which contain the DriveItem resources shared with the owner of the drive.

### Response

In this example, since the drive is the user's default drive, this returns items shared with the signed in user.

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remarks

DriveItems returned from the **sharedWithMe** action will always include the [**remoteItem**](../resources/remoteitem.md) facet which indicates they are items from a different drive.
To access the shared DriveItem resource, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "drives-get-remoteitem" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{remoteItem-driveId}/items/{remoteItem-id}
```
By default, **sharedWithMe** returns items shared within your own tenant. To include items shared from external tenants, append `?allowexternal=true` to the GET request.
