# List device transitive memberships

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get groups and administrative units that the device is a member of. This API request is transitive, and will also return all groups and administrative units the device is a nested member of.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Device.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Device.Read.All, Device.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]


## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/{id}/transitiveMemberOf
GET /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')/transitiveMemberOf
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the device is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
