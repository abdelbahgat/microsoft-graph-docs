# Update unifiedRoleDefinition

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the properties of a [unifiedRoleDefinition](../resources/unifiedroledefinition.md) object for an RBAC provider. You cannot update built-in roles. This feature requires an Azure AD Premium P1 or P2 license.

The following RBAC providers are currently supported:
- Cloud PC
- device management (Intune)
- directory (Azure AD) 


## Permissions

Depending on the RBAC provider and the permission type (delegated or application) that is needed, choose from the following tables the least privileged permission required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in the [Permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference). 

### For a Cloud PC provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.CloudPC, CloudPC.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.CloudPC, CloudPC.ReadWrite.All  |

### For a device management (Intune) provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | DeviceManagementRBAC.ReadWrite.All |

### For a directory (Azure AD) provider

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All   |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
