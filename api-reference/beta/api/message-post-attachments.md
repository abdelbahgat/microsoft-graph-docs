# Add attachment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to a message. 

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceattachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource. 

You can add an attachment to an existing [message](../resources/message.md) by posting to its attachments collection, or to a new 
message that is being [drafted](../api/user-post-messages.md), or [created and sent on the fly](../api/user-sendmail.md).

>**Note**: This operation limits the size of the attachment you can add to under 3 MB.
>
> However, if you're attaching to a message a file that is between 3MB and 150MB, you can [create an upload session](attachment-createuploadsession.md) and iteratively upload ranges of the file to attach it. See [attach large files to Outlook messages](/graph/outlook-large-attachments) for an example.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) in a user's mailbox.
```http
POST /me/messages/{id}/attachments
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/attachments

```
Attachments for a [message](../resources/message.md) contained in a child folder of a [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md) in a user's mailbox.  The
example below shows one level of nesting, but a message can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
POST /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/messages/{id}/attachments/{id}
