# Get place

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]
Get the properties and relationships of a [place](../resources/place.md) object specified by either its ID or email address. 

The **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [room](../resources/room.md), which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support. 
* A [workspace](../resources/workspace.md), which includes properties such as an email address for the workspace, and accessibility and capacity. 
* A [room list](../resources/roomlist.md), which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of **room** instances in that room list.

The **room**, **workspace**, and **roomList** resources are derived from the **place** object.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-only.md)]
