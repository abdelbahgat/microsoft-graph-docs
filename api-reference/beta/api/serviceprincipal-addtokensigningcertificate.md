# servicePrincipal: addTokenSigningCertificate

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Creates a self-signed signing certificate and returns a [selfSignedCertificate](../resources/selfsignedcertificate.md) object, which is the public part of the generated certificate. The self-signed signing certificate is composed of the following objects which are added to the [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md): 
+ The [keyCredentials](../resources/keycredential.md) object with the following objects:
    + A private key object with **usage** set to `Sign`.
    + A public key object with **usage** set to `Verify`.
+ The [passwordCredentials](../resources/passwordcredential.md) object.

All the objects have the same value of **customKeyIdentifier**.

The **passwordCredential** is used to open the PFX file (private key). It and the associated private key object have the same value of **keyId**. Once set during creation through the **displayName** property, the subject of the certificate cannot be updated. The **startDateTime** is set to the same time the certificate is created using the action. The **endDateTime** can be up to three years after the certificate is created.
