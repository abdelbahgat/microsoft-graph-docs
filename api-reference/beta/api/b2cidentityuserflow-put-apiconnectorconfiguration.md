# Configure userFlowApiConnectorConfiguration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the [apiConnectorConfiguration](../resources/userflowapiconnectorconfiguration.md) property in a [b2cIdentityUserFlow](../resources/b2cidentityuserflow.md) to enable or disable an API connector in a user flow. Each relationship of the [apiConnectorConfiguration](../resources/userflowapiconnectorconfiguration.md) corresponds to a specific step in the user flow that can be configured to call an API connector. You configure an API connector for a particular step one at a time as shown below.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported|
|Application|IdentityUserFlow.ReadWrite.All|

The work or school account needs to belong to one of the following roles:

* Global administrator
* External Identity User Flow administrator
