# channel: provisionEmail

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Provision an email address for a [channel](../resources/channel.md).

Microsoft Teams doesn't automatically provision an email address for a **channel** by default. To have Teams provision an email address, you can call **provisionEmail**, or through the Teams user interface, select **Get email address**, which triggers Teams to generate an email address if it has not already provisioned one.

To remove the email address of a **channel**, use the [removeEmail](channel-removeemail.md) method.

> **Notes**:
