# passwordAuthenticationMethod: resetPassword

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Initiate a reset for the password associated with a [password authentication method](../resources/passwordauthenticationmethod.md) object. This can only be done by an administrator with appropriate permissions and can't be performed on a user's own account.

This flow writes the new password to Microsoft Entra ID and pushes it to on-premises Active Directory if configured using password writeback. The admin can either provide a new password or have the system generate one. The user is prompted to change their password on their next sign in.

This reset is a long-running operation and will return a **Location** header with a link where the caller can periodically check for the status of the reset operation.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

Admins with *User Administrator*, *Helpdesk Administrator*, or *Password Administrator* roles can also reset passwords for non-admin users and a limited set of admin roles as defined in [Who can reset passwords](/azure/active-directory/roles/privileged-roles-permissions#who-can-reset-passwords).
