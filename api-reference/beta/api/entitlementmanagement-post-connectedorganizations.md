Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [connectedOrganization](../resources/connectedorganization.md) object.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/connectedOrganizations
```

## Request headers

|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [connectedOrganization](../resources/connectedorganization.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create the [connectedOrganization](../resources/connectedorganization.md).

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|displayName|String|The connected organization name. |
|description|String|The connected organization description.|
|identitySources|[identitySource](../resources/identitysource.md) collection|A collection with one element, the initial identity source in this connected organization.|
|state|connectedOrganizationState|The state of a connected organization defines whether assignment policies with requestor scope type `AllConfiguredConnectedOrganizationSubjects` are applicable or not. Possible values are: `configured`, `proposed`.|

The single member of the identitySources collection should be of either the [domainIdentitySource](../resources/domainidentitysource.md) or [externalDomainFederation](../resources/externaldomainfederation.md) type.  If the caller provides a domainIdentitySource, the call is successful, and the domain corresponds to a registered domain of an Azure Active Directory tenant, then the resulting connectedOrganization that is created will have an identitySources collection containing a single member of the [azureActiveDirectoryTenant](../resources/azureactivedirectorytenant.md) type.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [connectedOrganization](../resources/connectedorganization.md) object in the response body.
