# Get device

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get the properties and relationships of a device object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **device** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Device.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Device.Read.All, Device.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

The `{id}` in the request is the value of the **id** property of the device, not the **deviceId** property.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/{id}
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [device](../resources/device.md) object in the response body.
