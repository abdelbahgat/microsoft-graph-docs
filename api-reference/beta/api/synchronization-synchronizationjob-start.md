# Start synchronizationJob

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Start an existing synchronization job. If the job is in a paused state, it will continue processing changes from the point where it was paused. If the job is in quarantine, the quarantine status will be cleared. Do not create scripts to call the start job continuously while it's running because that can cause the service to stop running. Use the start job only when the job is currently paused or in quarantine.
