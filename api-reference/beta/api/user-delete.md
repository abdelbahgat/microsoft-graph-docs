# Delete a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Delete user.  

When deleted, user resources are moved to a temporary container and can be restored within 30 days.  After that time, they are permanently deleted.  To learn more, see [deletedItems](../resources/directory.md).

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/user-delete-permissions.md)]

The calling user must be assigned one of the following [Microsoft Entra roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json):

- User Administrator
- Privileged Authentication Administrator
- Global Administrator

To delete users with privileged administrator roles in delegated scenarios, the app must be assigned the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission, and the calling user must have a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).

In app-only scenarios, the *User.ReadWrite.All* application permission isn't enough privilege to delete users with privileged administrative roles. The app must be assigned a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).
