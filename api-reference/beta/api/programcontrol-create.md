# Create programControl (deprecated)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer.md)]

In the Azure AD [access reviews](../resources/accessreviews-root.md) feature, create a new [programControl](../resources/programcontrol.md) object.  This links an access review to a program.

Prior to making this request, the caller must have previously

- [created a program](program-create.md) or [retrieved a program](program-list.md), to have the value of `programId` to include in the request,
- [created an access review](accessreview-create.md) or [retrieved an access review](accessreview-get.md), to have the value of `controlId` to include in the request, and
- [retrieved the list of program control types](programcontroltype-list.md), to have the value of `controlTypeId` to include in the request.


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account)     | ProgramControl.ReadWrite.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application                            |  ProgramControl.ReadWrite.All  |

The signed in user must also be in a directory role that permits them to create a **programControl**. 

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /programControls
```
## Request headers
| Name         | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| Authorization | string | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [programControl](../resources/programcontrol.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are required when you create a program control.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| `programId`              |`String`                | The programId of the program this control is going to become a part of.                             |
| `controlId`              |`String`                | The controlId of the control, in particular the identifier of an access review.                                                |
| `controlTypeId`          |`String`                | The programControlType identifies the type of program control - for example, a control linking to guest access reviews. |

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201, Created` response code and a [programControl](../resources/programcontrol.md) object in the response body.
