# List group members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a list of the group's direct members. A group can have users, contacts, devices, service principals, and other groups as members. This operation is not transitive.

When a group contains more than 100 members, Microsoft Graph returns a `@odata.nextLink` property in the response that contains a URL to the next page of results. If that property is present, continue making additional requests with the `@odata.nextLink` URL in each response, until all the results are returned, as described in [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                                           |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

> **Note:** To list the members of a hidden membership group, the Member.Read.Hidden permission is required.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the group. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization    | Bearer {token}. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |
