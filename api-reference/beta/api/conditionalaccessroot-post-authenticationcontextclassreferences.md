## Request body

You can specify the following properties when creating an **authenticationContextClassReference**.

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
| id | String|Identifier used to reference the authentication context class. The id is used to trigger step-up authentication for the referenced authentication requirements and is the value that will be issued in the `acrs` claim of an access token. This value in the claim is used to verify that the required authentication context has been satisfied. The allowed values are `c1` through `c25`. Required.|
|displayName|String|A friendly name that identifies the authenticationContextClassReference object when building user-facing admin experiences. For example, a selection UX. Optional.|
|description|String|A short explanation of the policies that are enforced by authenticationContextClassReference. This value should be used to provide secondary text to describe the authentication context class reference when building user-facing admin experiences. For example, a selection UX. Optional.|
|isAvailable|Boolean|Indicates whether the authenticationContextClassReference has been published by the security admin and is ready for use by apps. When it is set to `false`, it should not be shown in admin UX experiences because the value is not currently available for selection. Optional.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [authenticationContextClassReference](../resources/authenticationcontextclassreference.md) object in the response body.
