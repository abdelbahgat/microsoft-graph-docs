# List sharing permissions on a driveItem

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List the effective sharing permissions on a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

## Access to sharing permissions

The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.

* For the owner of the item, all sharing permissions will be returned. This includes co-owners.
* For a non-owner caller, only the sharing permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
* Sharing permission properties that contain secrets (e.g. `shareId` and `webUrl`) are only returned for callers that are able to create the sharing permission.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/root:/{path}:/permissions
GET /sites/{siteId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
GET /users/{userId}/drive/items/{itemId}/permissions
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to customize the response.

## Optional request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | string | If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resources in the response body.

Effective sharing permissions of a DriveItem can come from two sources:

* Sharing permissions applied directly on the DriveItem itself
* Sharing permissions inherited from the DriveItem's ancestors

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the **inheritedFrom** property.
This property is an [**itemReference**](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.

## Example

This example retrieves the collection of permissions on an item in the signed in user's drive.

### Response

This example response includes three permissions, the first is a sharing link with edit permissions, the second is an explicit permission for a user named John, which was inherited from a parent folder, and the third is a read-write sharing link created by an application.

## Remarks

The **permissions** relationship of DriveItem cannot be expanded as part of a call to [get DriveItem](driveitem-get.md) or a collection of DriveItems.
You must access the permissions property directly.
