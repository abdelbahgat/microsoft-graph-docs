# List deleted items owned by a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieves a list of recently deleted items owned by the specified user.  

Currently, list deleted items functionality is supported only for [application](../resources/application.md) and [group](../resources/group.md) resources owned by the user.

This is a service action, which means it does not support pagination.  The API returns up to 1,000 deleted objects owned by the user, sorted by ID.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn
more, including how to choose permissions, see
[Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| --- | --- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Not supported. |
| Application | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All  |
