# Publish teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Publish an [app](../resources/teamsapp.md) to the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
Specifically, this API publishes the app to your organization's catalog (the tenant app catalog);
the created resource has a **distributionMethod** property value of `organization`.

The **requiresReview** property allows any user to submit an app for review by an administrator. Admins can approve or reject these apps via this API or the Microsoft Teams admin center.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/global-us.md)]

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission Type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:----------------------------------     |:-------------|
| Delegated (work or school account) | AppCatalog.Submit, AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

> **Note**: Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps
```

To publish an app that requires a review:

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps?requiresReview={Boolean}
```

## Query parameters

|Property|Type|Description|
|----|----|----|
|requiresReview| Boolean | This optional query parameter triggers the app review process. Users with admin privileges can submit apps without triggering a review. If users want to request a review before publishing, they must set **requiresReview** to `true`. A user who has admin privileges can opt not to set **requiresReview** or set the value to `false`  and the app will be considered approved and will publish instantly.|

## Request headers

| Header        | Value           |
|:--------------|:--------------  |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/zip. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, include a Teams zip manifest payload. For details, see [Create an app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-package).  

Each app in the app catalog must have a unique manifest ID.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object.
