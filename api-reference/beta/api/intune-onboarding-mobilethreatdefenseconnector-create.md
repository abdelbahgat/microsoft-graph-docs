|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|id|String||
|lastHeartbeatDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime of last Heartbeat recieved from the Mobile Threat Defense partner|
|partnerState|[mobileThreatPartnerTenantState](../resources/intune-onboarding-mobilethreatpartnertenantstate.md)|Mobile Threat Defense partner state for this account. Possible values are: `unavailable`, `available`, `enabled`, `unresponsive`, `notSetUp`, `error`, `unknownFutureValue`.|
|androidMobileApplicationManagementEnabled|Boolean|When TRUE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner can be used during Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluations for Android devices. When FALSE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should not be used during Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluations for Android devices. Only one partner per platform may be enabled for Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluation. Default value is FALSE.|
|iosMobileApplicationManagementEnabled|Boolean|When TRUE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner can be used during Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluations for IOS devices. When FALSE, inidicates that data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should not be used during Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluations for IOS devices. Only one partner per platform may be enabled for Mobile Application Management (MAM) evaluation. Default value is FALSE.|
|windowsMobileApplicationManagementEnabled|Boolean|When TRUE, app protection policies using the Device Threat Level rule will evaluate devices including data from this connector for Windows. When FALSE, Intune will not use device risk details sent over this connector during app protection policies calculation for policies with a Device Threat Level configured. Existing devices that are not compliant due to risk levels obtained from this connector will also become compliant.|
|androidEnabled|Boolean|For Android, set whether data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should be used during compliance evaluations|
|iosEnabled|Boolean|For IOS, get or set whether data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should be used during compliance evaluations|

|macEnabled|Boolean|For Mac, get or set whether data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner should be used during compliance evaluations|
|androidDeviceBlockedOnMissingPartnerData|Boolean|For Android, set whether Intune must receive data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner prior to marking a device compliant|
|iosDeviceBlockedOnMissingPartnerData|Boolean|For IOS, set whether Intune must receive data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner prior to marking a device compliant|
|windowsDeviceBlockedOnMissingPartnerData|Boolean|When TRUE, inidicates that Intune must receive data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner prior to marking a device compliant for Windows. When FALSE, inidicates that Intune may make a device compliant without receiving data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner for Windows. Default value is FALSE.|
|macDeviceBlockedOnMissingPartnerData|Boolean|For Mac, get or set whether Intune must receive data from the Mobile Threat Defense partner prior to marking a device compliant|
|partnerUnsupportedOsVersionBlocked|Boolean|Get or set whether to block devices on the enabled platforms that do not meet the minimum version requirements of the Mobile Threat Defense partner|
|partnerUnresponsivenessThresholdInDays|Int32|Get or Set days the per tenant tolerance to unresponsiveness for this partner integration|
