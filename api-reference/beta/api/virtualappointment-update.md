| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                            |

| Delegated (work or school account)     | VirtualAppointment.ReadWrite, OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite                                  |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                         |

> [!NOTE]
