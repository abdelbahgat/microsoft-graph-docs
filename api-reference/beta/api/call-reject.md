# call: reject

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Enable a bot to reject an incoming call. The incoming call request can be an invite from a participant in a group call or a peer-to-peer call. If an invite to a group call is received, the notification will contain the **chatInfo** and **meetingInfo** parameters.

The bot is expected to answer or reject the call before the call times out. The current timeout value is 15 seconds.

This API does not end existing calls that have already been answered. Use [delete call](../api/call-delete.md) to end a call.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Not Supported                       |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not Supported                       |
| Application     | None                                                       |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /app/calls/{id}/reject
POST /communications/calls/{id}/reject
```
> **Note:** The `/app` path is deprecated. Going forward, use the `/communications` path.

|reason|String|The rejection reason. Possible values are `None`, `Busy` and `Forbidden` |
|callbackUri|String|This allows bots to provide a specific callback URI for the current call to receive later notifications. If this property has not been set, the bot's global callback URI will be used instead. This must be `https`.|
