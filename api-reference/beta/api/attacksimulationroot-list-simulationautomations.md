## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$count`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, `$skip`, `$top`, and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. You can use the `$filter` and `$orderby` query parameters on the **displayName** and **status** properties.

The following are examples of their use:

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$count=true
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$filter={property} eq '{property-value}'&$top=5
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$orderby={property}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$skip={skipCount}
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$top=1
GET /security/attackSimulation/simulationAutomations?$select={property}
```
