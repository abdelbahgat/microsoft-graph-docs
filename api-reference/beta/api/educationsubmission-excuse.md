# educationSubmission: excuse

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Excuse a submission. Excused submissions aren't included in average grade calculations. Grading rubrics and feedback are deleted. Only teachers can perform this action. 

If the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header is provided, the excused submission retains the **excused** status. Otherwise, the submission status changes to **returned**. For more information about how to use this header, see the [Examples](#examples) section.
