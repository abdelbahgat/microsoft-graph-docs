# List executionScope

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

List the users that meet the [execution conditions](../resources/identitygovernance-workflowexecutionconditions.md) regardless of whether they have already been processed by the [workflow](../resources/identitygovernance-workflow.md).

The workflow engine periodically evaluates the users that meet the execution conditions. The results will not be up to date if the execution conditions have been changed recently, relevant attributes on the user have been changed recently or the [time based trigger](../resources/identitygovernance-timebasedattributetrigger.md) has been reached recently.

The API is only supported for workflows with [trigger and scope based](../resources/identitygovernance-triggerandscopebasedconditions.md) [execution conditions](../resources/identitygovernance-workflowexecutionconditions.md). Furthermore, results are only returned if the workflows schedule (isSchedulingEnabled) is enabled.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).
