# Delete openTypeExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [todo-deprecate-basetaskapi-sharedfeature](../includes/todo-deprecate-basetaskapi-sharedfeature.md)]

Delete an open extension ([openTypeExtension](../resources/opentypeextension.md) object) from the specified instance of a resource. 

See the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section for the list of resources that support open extensions.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource you're deleting the extension from and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing more privileged permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |

| [baseTask](../resources/basetask.md) (deprecated) | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite.All |

| [todoTasklist](../resources/todotasklist.md)  | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite | Tasks.ReadWrite.All |
| [user](../resources/user.md) | User.ReadWrite | User.ReadWrite | User.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

In the request, identify the resource instance, use the **extensions** 
navigation property of that instance to identify the extension, and do a `DELETE` on that extension instance.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /administrativeUnits/{administrativeUnitId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /devices/{deviceId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{userId|userPrincipalName}/events/{eventId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{groupId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{groupId}/events/{eventId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{groupId}/threads/{threadIid}/posts/{postId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{userIid|userPrincipalName}/messages/{messageId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /organization/{organizationId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{userId|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{contactId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{userId|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/todo/lists/{listId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/todo/lists/{listId}/tasks/{taskId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/tasks/lists/{listId}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/me/tasks/lists/{listId}/tasks/{taskId}/extensions/{extensionId}
```

>**Note:** The above syntax shows some common ways to identify a resource instance, in order to delete an extension from it. 
All other syntax that allows you to identify these resource instances supports deleting open extensions from them in a similar way.
