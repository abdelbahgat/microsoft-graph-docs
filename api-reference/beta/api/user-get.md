# Get a user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object.

This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/user.md#properties) section. To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](user-get.md) for the user and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option. Because the **user** resource supports [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **user** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, User.ReadWrite, User.ReadBasic.All, User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.Read, User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

> [!TIP]
> 1. Calling the `/me` endpoint requires a signed-in user and therefore a delegated permission. Application permissions are not supported when using the `/me` endpoint.
>2. The `User.Read` permission allows the app to read the profile, and discover relationships such as the group membership, reports and manager of the signed-in user only.

## HTTP request

For a specific user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}
```

> [!TIP]
> 
> + When the **userPrincipalName** begins with a `$` character, the GET request URL syntax `/users/$x@y.com` fails with a `400 Bad Request` error code. This is because this request URL violates the OData URL convention, which expects only system query options to be prefixed with a `$` character. Remove the slash (/) after `/users` and enclose the **userPrincipalName** in parentheses and single quotes, as follows: `/users('$x@y.com')`. For example, `/users('$AdeleVance@contoso.com')`.
> + To query a B2B user using the **userPrincipalName**, encode the hash (#) character. That is, replace the `#` symbol with `%23`. For example, `/users/AdeleVance_adatum.com%23EXT%23@contoso.com`.

For the signed-in user:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$select` [OData query parameter](/graph/query-parameters) to retrieve specific user properties, including those that are not returned by default.

### Retrieve extensions and associated data

| Extension type                     | Comments                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| onPremisesExtensionAttributes 1-15 | Returned only with `$select`.                                                                         |
| Schema extensions                  | Returned only with `$select`.                                                                         |
| Open extensions                    | Returned only through the [Get open extension](opentypeextension-get.md) operation. |
| Directory extensions               | Returned only with `$select`.                                                                         |

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.|
| Content-Type   | application/json |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [user](../resources/user.md) object in the response body. It returns the default properties unless you use `$select` to specify specific properties.

This method returns `202 Accepted` when the request has been processed successfully but the server requires more time to complete related background operations.

### Example 4: Get the custom security attribute assignments of the specified user

The following example gets the custom security attributes of the specified user.

Attribute #1

+ Attribute set: `Engineering`
+ Attribute: `Project`
+ Attribute data type: Collection of Strings
+ Attribute value: `["Baker","Cascade"]`

Attribute #2

+ Attribute set: `Engineering`
+ Attribute: `CostCenter`
+ Attribute data type: Collection of Integers
+ Attribute value: `[1001]`

Attribute #3

+ Attribute set: `Engineering`
+ Attribute: `Certification`
+ Attribute data type: Boolean
+ Attribute value: `true`

Attribute #4

+ Attribute set: `Marketing`
+ Attribute: `Level`
+ Attribute data type: String
+ Attribute value: `"Public"`

To get custom security attribute assignments, the calling principal must be assigned the Attribute Assignment Reader or Attribute Assignment Administrator role and must be granted the *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.Read.All* or *CustomSecAttributeAssignment.ReadWrite.All* permission.
