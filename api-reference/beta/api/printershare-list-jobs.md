## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

To use the Universal Print service, the user or app's tenant must have an active Universal Print subscription, a permission that grants [Get printerShare](printershare-get.md) access, and one of the permissions listed in the following table. 

To read print jobs from another user, the signed in user needs to be a print administrator and have the PrintJob.ReadBasic.All, PrintJob.Read.All, PrintJob.ReadWriteBasic.All, or PrintJob.ReadWrite.All permission.

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
