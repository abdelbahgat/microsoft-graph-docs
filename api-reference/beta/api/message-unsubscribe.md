# message: unsubscribe

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Submits a email request on behalf of the signed-in user to unsubscribe from an email distribution list. Uses the information in the `List-Unsubscribe` header.

Message senders can use mailing lists in a user-friendly way by including an option for recipients to opt out. They can do so by specifying the `List-Unsubscribe` header in each message following [RFC-2369](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2369.html).

**Note** In particular, for the **unsubscribe** action to work, the sender must specify `mailto:` and not URL-based unsubscribe information.

Setting that header would also set the **unsubscribeEnabled** property of the [message](../resources/message.md) instance to `true`, and the **unsubscribeData** property to the header data.

If the **unsubscribeEnabled** property of a message is `true`, you can use the **unsubscribe** action to unsubscribe the user from similar future messages as managed by the message sender.

A successful **unsubscribe** action moves the message to the **Deleted Items** folder. The actual exclusion of the user from future mail distribution is managed by the sender.
