Read the properties and relationships of a [cloudPcExportJob](../resources/cloudpcexportjob.md) object.

Use this GET operation to verify the **exportJobStatus** property of the **cloudPcExportJob** resource. When the property becomes `completed`, the report has finished downloading in the location specified by the **exportUrl** property.
