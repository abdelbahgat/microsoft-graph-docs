[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create an upload session to iteratively upload ranges of a file as an attachment to a [todoTask](../resources/todotask.md).

As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential `PUT` queries. The request headers for each `PUT` operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows the transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during the upload.

The following are the steps to attach a file to a Microsoft To Do task using an upload session:

1. Create an upload session.
2. Within that upload session, iteratively upload ranges of bytes (up to 4 MB each time) until all the bytes of the file have been uploaded, and the file is attached to the **todoTask**.
3. Optional: Delete the upload session.

>**Note:** Use this approach to attach a file of any supported size between 0 MB to 25 MB.

For an example that describes the end-to-end attachment process, see [attach files to a To Do task](/graph/todo-attachments).
