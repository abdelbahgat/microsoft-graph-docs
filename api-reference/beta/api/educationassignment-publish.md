# educationAssignment: publish

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Change the state of an [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) from its original `draft` status to the `published` status. 

You can change the state from `draft` to `scheduled` if the **assignment** is scheduled for a future date. 

Only a teacher in the class can make this call. When an **assignment** is in draft status, students will not see the **assignment**, nor will there be any submission objects. When you call this API, [educationSubmission](../resources/educationsubmission.md) objects are created and the assignment appears in the student's list.

The state of the **assignment** goes back to `draft` if there is any backend failure during publish process.

To update the properties of a published **assignment**, see [update an assignment](../api/educationassignment-update.md).

To update the properties of a published assignment, see [update an assignment](../api/educationassignment-update.md).
