# Update insightsSettings

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Update the privacy settings to display or return the specified type of insights in an organization. The type of settings can be item insights or people insights.

To learn more about customizing insights privacy for your organization, see:
-  [Customize item insights privacy](/graph/insights-customize-item-insights-privacy) 
-  [Customize people insights privacy](/graph/insights-customize-people-insights-privacy)

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Not supported. |


>**Note:** Using delegated permissions for this operation requires the signed-in user to have a global administrator role.
## HTTP request

To update settings for item insights:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /organization/{organizationId}/settings/itemInsights
```

To update settings for people insights:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /organization/{organizationId}/settings/peopleInsights
```

## Request headers

| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|isEnabledInOrganization|Boolean| `true` if the specified type of insights are enabled for the organization; `false` if the specified type of insights are disabled for all users without exceptions. Default is `true`. Optional.|
|disabledForGroup|String| The ID of an Azure AD group, of which the specified type of insights are disabled for its members. Default is `empty`. Optional.|

>**Note:** This operation does not verify the **disabledForGroup** property value if you include it in the request body. If you set the **disabledForGroup** property to a string, this operation does not check the existence of the corresponding Azure AD group. This means, if you set **disabledForGroup** to an Azure AD group that does not exist or is deleted afterwards, this operation will not be able to identify any group membership and disable item or people insights for any specific users. If **isEnabledInOrganization** is set to `true`, the operation will enable the specified type of insights for _all_ the users in the organization. 
## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [insightsSettings](../resources/insightssettings.md) object in the response body.
