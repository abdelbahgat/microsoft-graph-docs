# message: delta

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Get a set of messages that have been added, deleted, or updated in a specified folder.

A **delta** function call for messages in a folder is similar to a GET request, except that by appropriately 
applying [state tokens](/graph/delta-query-overview) in one or more of these calls, you can [query for incremental changes in the messages in 
that folder](/graph/delta-query-messages). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of a user's messages without 
having to fetch the entire set of messages from the server every time.  

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/delta
GET /users/{id}/mailFolders/{id}/messages/delta
```

## Query parameters

Tracking changes in messages incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion of the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL provided in the response. 
You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, simply copy and apply the `@odata.nextLink` or `@odata.deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.

| Query parameter	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same message collection, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `@odata.deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that collection.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](/graph/delta-query-overview) returned in the `@odata.nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same message collection. |

### OData query parameters

- You can use a `$select` query parameter as in any GET request to specify only the properties your need for best performance. The 
_id_ property is always returned. 
- Delta query support `$select`, `$top`, and `$expand` for messages. 
- There is limited support for `$filter` and `$orderby`:
  * The only supported `$filter` expresssions are `$filter=receivedDateTime+ge+{value}` 
  or `$filter=receivedDateTime+gt+{value}`.
  * The only supported `$orderby` expression is `$orderby=receivedDateTime+desc`. If you do not include
  an `$orderby` expression, the return order is not guaranteed. 
- There is no support for `$search`.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | string  | application/json. Required. |
| Prefer | string  | odata.maxpagesize={x}. Optional. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [message](../resources/message.md) collection object in the response body.

## Example
##### Request
The following example shows how to make a single **delta** function call, and limit the maximum number of messages 
in the response body to 2.

To track changes in the messages in a folder, you would make one or more **delta** function calls to get the set
of incremental changes since the last delta query. For an example that shows a round of delta query calls, see 
[Get incremental changes to messages in a folder](/graph/delta-query-messages).

##### Response
If the request is successful, the response would include a state token, which is either a _skipToken_  
(in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header) or a _deltaToken_ (in an _@odata.deltaLink_ response header). 
Respectively, they indicate whether you should continue with the round or you have completed 
getting all the changes for that round.

The response below shows a _skipToken_ in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header.

Note: The response object shown here might be shortened for readability.
