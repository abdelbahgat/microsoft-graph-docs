| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [ipNamedLocation](../resources/ipnamedlocation.md) or [countryNamedLocation](../resources/countrynamedlocation.md) object. You must specify the **@odata.type** of the derived type, that is, `#microsoft.graph.ipNamedLocation` for an [ipNamedLocation](../resources/ipnamedlocation.md) object or `#microsoft.graph.countryNamedLocation` for a [countryNamedLocation](../resources/countrynamedlocation.md) object.

The following table lists the properties that are required to create an [ipNamedLocation](../resources/ipnamedlocation.md) object.

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|displayName|String|Human-readable name of the location. Required.|
|ipRanges|[ipRange](../resources/iprange.md) collection|List of IP address ranges in IPv4 CIDR format (e.g. 1.2.3.4/32) or any allowable IPv6 format from IETF RFC596. Required. The **@odata.type** of the ipRange is also required.|

The following table lists the properties that are required to create an [countryNamedLocation](../resources/countrynamedlocation.md) object.
