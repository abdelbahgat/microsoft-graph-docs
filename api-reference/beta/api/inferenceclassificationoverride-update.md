# Update inferenceClassificationOverride

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Change the **classifyAs** field of a [focused Inbox](../resources/manage-focused-inbox.md) override as specified.

You cannot use PATCH to change any other fields in an [inferenceClassificationOverride](../resources/inferenceclassificationoverride.md) instance.

If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her display name, you can use [POST](inferenceclassification-post-overrides.md) to force an update to the name field in the existing override.

If an override exists for a sender and the sender changes his/her SMTP address, [deleting](inferenceclassificationoverride-delete.md) the existing override and [creating](inferenceclassification-post-overrides.md) a new one with
the new SMTP address is the only way to "update" the override for this sender.
