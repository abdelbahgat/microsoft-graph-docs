# Add app to chat

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Install a [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) to the specified [chat](../resources/chat.md).

> **Notes**:
> - If the chat is associated with an [onlineMeeting](../resources/onlinemeeting.md) instance, then, effectively, the **teamsApp** will get installed to the meeting.
> - Currently, installing an app that requires resource-specific consent permissions is not supported in application context.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForChat, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentForChat |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Chat.Manage.Chat<sup>2</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteSelfForChat.All<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteForChat.All<sup>1</sup>, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForChat.All, TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentForChat.All |

> **Note**: 
<br><sup>1</sup> These permissions cannot be used to install apps that require consent to resource-specific permissions.
<br><sup>2</sup> These permissions use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

## HTTP request

<!-- {
"blockType": "ignored"
} -->

```

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required.  |

## Request body

The request body should contain the catalog generated app ID for the app catalog. For details, see [teamsApp properties](../resources/teamsapp.md#properties).
The following table lists additional parameters that can be used with the request body.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|consentedPermissionSet|[teamsAppPermissionSet](../resources/teamsapppermissionset.md)|Set of resource-specific permissions that are being consented to.|

> **Note**: The permissions consented to during the install must be same as the resource-specific permissions present in the [teamsAppDefinition](../resources/teamsAppDefinition.md) of the app. To get the application and delegated resource-specific permissions, see [Example 7](../api/appcatalogs-list-teamsapps.md#example-7-list-applications-with-a-given-id-and-return-only-the-resource-specific-permissions-required-by-the-app).
