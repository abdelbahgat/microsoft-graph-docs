# Create emailThreatSubmission
Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new [emailThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailthreatsubmission.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account)|ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite, ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All|
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account)|Not supported|
|Application|ThreatSubmission.ReadWrite.All|

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /security/threatSubmission/emailThreats
```

## Request headers
|Name|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|Bearer {token}. Required.|
|Content-Type|application/json. Required.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of either an [emailContentThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailcontentthreatsubmission.md) object or an [emailUrlThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailurlthreatsubmission.md) object.

The **emailContentThreatSubmission** and **emailUrlThreatSubmission** resources are both subtypes of the **emailThreatSubmission** entity. Choose what to include in the request body based on the following:  
* If you want to create a submission with the email content itself, include an **emailContentThreatSubmission** object.
* If you want to create a submission with a URL that points to the email, include an **emailUrlThreatSubmission** object.

After the **emailContentThreatSubmission** or **emailUrlThreatSubmision** objects are created, the threat submission service just stores some metadata about the email. The email content is not stored. As a result, an **emailThreatSubmission** entity is created.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [emailThreatSubmission](../resources/security-emailthreatsubmission.md) object in the response body.
