## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If the site was not previously published, then this method returns a `204 No Content` response code on a successful delete. If the site was previously published, then this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [browserSiteList](../resources/browsersitelist.md) object in the response body with the status as `pendingDelete`.
