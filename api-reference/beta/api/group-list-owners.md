## HTTP request

GET /groups/{id}/owners

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, `$top`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the group owners that are users. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).
