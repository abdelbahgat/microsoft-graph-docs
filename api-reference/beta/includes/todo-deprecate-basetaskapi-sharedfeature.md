>[!CAUTION]
>Existing apps that use this feature with [baseTask](/graph/api/resources/basetask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [baseTaskList](/graph/api/resources/basetasklist?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) should be updated, as the to-do API set built on these resources is deprecated as of May 31, 2022. That API set will stop returning data on August 31, 2022. Please use the API set built on [todoTask](/graph/api/resources/todotask?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
