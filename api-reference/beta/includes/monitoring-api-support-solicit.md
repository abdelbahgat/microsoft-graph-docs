> [!Note]
> This API is part of the [alert monitoring API set](/graph/api/resources/devicemanagement-monitoring?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) which currently supports only [Windows 365](/windows-365/overview) and Cloud PC scenarios. The API set allows admins to set up rules to alert issues with provisioning Cloud PCs, uploading Cloud PC images, and checking Azure network connections.
