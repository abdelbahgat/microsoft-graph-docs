# group resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group, which can be a Microsoft 365 group, a team in Microsoft Teams, or a security group. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

For performance reasons, the [create](../api/group-post-groups.md), [get](../api/group-get.md), and [list](../api/group-list.md) operations return only a subset of more commonly used properties by default. These _default_ properties are noted in the [Properties](#properties) section. To get any of the properties that are not returned by default, specify them in a `$select` OData query option.

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

> **Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365 groups support group collaboration**. You can use most of the Microsoft 365 groups API with Microsoft Teams. To create a [team](team.md), first [create group](../api/group-post-groups.md) and then [add a team to it](../api/team-put-teams.md). For details, see the [Microsoft Teams overview](teams-api-overview.md).
