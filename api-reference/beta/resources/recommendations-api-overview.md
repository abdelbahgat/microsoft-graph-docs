# Use the Microsoft Entra recommendations API to implement Microsoft Entra ID best practices for your tenant

Microsoft Entra recommendations are personalized and actionable insights for you to implement Microsoft Entra ID best practices in your tenant. The Microsoft Entra recommendation service runs daily to check your tenant against predefined conditions for every recommendation. If the service detects that a recommendation applies to your tenant, the corresponding recommendation object is generated and its status is set to active.

Use the recommendations API in Microsoft Graph to identify and track the insights, assess and apply the guidance provided for implementing the best practices, and keep your tenant healthy, secure and optimized.

## Manage recommendations

Microsoft Entra recommendations are made up of two building blocks: **recommendations** and **the Microsoft Entra resources they apply to**.

A single recommendation can apply to one or more Microsoft Entra resource instances. For example, a recommendation relating to expiring application credentials will reference all apps in your tenant that have expiring application credentials.

For each recommendation, you have the following data:

- The type of recommendation. Eight types are currently supported. For more information about types of recommendations, see [Types of recommendations](#types-of-recommendations).
- The Microsoft Entra resources to which the recommendation applies. These include users, groups, and applications.
- The recommended action plan to address the recommendation.
- Where applicable, when Microsoft Entra ID recommends the recommendation to have been completed before it impacts the associated service.
- The impact of the recommendation, which can be tenant-wide or resource-specific.
- A Microsoft-assigned priority ranking for the recommendation.
- The status of the recommendation such as whether it's still active or has been completed, dismissed, or postponed to a future date.

### Types of recommendations

Eight types of recommendations are currently available in Microsoft Entra recommendations. These recommendations are identified in a **recommendationType** property that's part of the **recommendation** object in Microsoft Graph.

The following table lists the recommendation types that are available, and maps the Microsoft Graph values to the user-friendly names that are used on the Microsoft Entra admin center.

| recommendationType          | Friendly name in the Microsoft Entra admin center                                                                              | Comments                                                                                                                                                                        |

## API scenarios

You manage recommendations through the [recommendation resource type](recommendation.md) and its associated methods. This resource type exposes the **impactedResources** relationship that you use to query the Microsoft Entra resource to which the recommendations apply.
