# Working with Microsoft 365 usage reports in Microsoft Graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

With Microsoft Graph, you can access Microsoft 365 usage reports resources to get the information about how people in your business are using Microsoft 365 services. For example, you can identify who is using a service a lot and reaching quotas, or who might not need a Microsoft 365 license at all. 

For details about the settings that govern identification/de-identification of information in the Microsoft 365 usage reports data, see [Microsoft 365 Reports in the admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/activity-reports/activity-reports) .

## Authorization

Microsoft Graph controls access to resources via permissions. You must specify the permissions you need in order to access Reports resources. Typically, you specify permissions in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) portal. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference) and [Reports permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#reports-permissions).

## Settings

In Microsoft 365 reports, user information such as usernames, groups, and sites is concealed; actual values are not displayed. You can use the [adminReportSettings](/graph/api/resources/adminreportsettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) API to control the display of user information in the reports.

## Cloud deployments
