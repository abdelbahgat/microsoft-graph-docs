# forwardingProfile resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.networkaccess

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A forwarding profile determines which types of traffic are routed through the Global Secure Access services and which ones are skipped. The handling of specific traffic is determined by the forwarding policies that are added to the forwarding profile.

Inherits from [microsoft.graph.networkaccess.profile](../resources/networkaccess-profile.md).
