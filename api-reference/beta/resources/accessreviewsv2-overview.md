# Azure AD access reviews

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE [accessreviews-disclaimer-v2](../../includes/accessreviews-disclaimer-v2.md)]

Use [Azure AD access reviews](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-azure-ad-controls-access-reviews-overview) to configure one-time or recurring access reviews for attestation of users' rights to access Azure AD resources. These Azure AD resources include groups, service principals, access packages, and privileged roles.

Typical customer scenarios for access reviews include:

- Customers can review and certify guest user access to groups through group memberships. Reviewers can use the insights that are provided to efficiently decide whether guests should have continued access.
- Customers can review and certify employee access to Azure AD resources.
- Customers can review and audit assignments to Azure AD privileged roles. This supports organizations in the management of privileged access.

Note that the access reviews feature, including the API, is included in Azure AD Premium P2.  The tenant where an access review is being created must have a valid purchased or trial Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 subscription. For more information about the license requirements, see [Access reviews license requirements](/azure/active-directory/governance/access-reviews-overview#license-requirements).

## Role and application permission authorization checks

The following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference) are required for a calling user to manage access reviews.

| Operation | Application permissions | Required directory role of the calling user |
|:------------------|:------------|:--------------------------------------------|
| Read | AccessReview.Read.All or AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator, Global Reader, Security Administrator, Security Reader or User Administrator |
| Create, Update or Delete | AccessReview.ReadWrite.All | Global Administrator or User Administrator |

In addition, a user who is an assigned reviewer of an access review can manage their decisions, without needing to be in a directory role.
