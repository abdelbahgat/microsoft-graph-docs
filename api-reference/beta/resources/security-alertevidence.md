# alertEvidence resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Evidence related to an [alert](security-alert.md).

This is the base type of [analyzedMessageEvidence](security-analyzedmessageevidence.md), [cloudApplicationEvidence](security-cloudapplicationevidence.md), [deviceEvidence](security-deviceevidence.md), [fileEvidence](security-fileevidence.md), [ipEvidence](security-ipEvidence.md), [mailboxEvidence](security-mailboxevidence.md), [mailClusterEvidence](security-mailclusterevidence.md), [oauthApplicationEvidence](security-oauthapplicationevidence.md), [processEvidence](security-processevidence.md), [registryKeyEvidence](security-registrykeyevidence.md), [registryValueEvidence](security-registryvalueevidence.md), [securityGroupEvidence](security-securitygroupevidence.md), [urlEvidence](security-urlevidence.md), and [userEvidence](security-userevidence.md).

This alert evidence base type and its derived evidence types provide a means to organize and track rich data about each artifact involved in an **alert**. For example, an **alert** about an attacker's IP address logging into a cloud service using a compromised user account can track the following evidence:
- [IP evidence](security-ipevidence.md) with the roles of `attacker` and `source`, remediation status of `running`, and verdict of `malicious`.
- [Cloud application evidence](security-cloudapplicationevidence.md) with a role of `contextual`.
- [Mailbox evidence](security-mailboxevidence.md) for the hacked user account with a role of `compromised`.
