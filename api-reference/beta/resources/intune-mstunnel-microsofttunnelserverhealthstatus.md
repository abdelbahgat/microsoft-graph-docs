|unknown|0|Indicates that the health status of the server is unknown. This occurs when no health status has been reported, for example when the server is initialized, but has not yet been evaluated for its health.|
|healthy|1|Indicates that the health status of the server is healthy. This should be the normal operational health status.|
|unhealthy|2|Indicates that the health status of the server is unhealthy. This is normally a transient condition that will last up to 5 minutes.
