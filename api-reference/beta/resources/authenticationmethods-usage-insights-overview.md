# Working with the authentication methods usage report API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The authentication methods usage reports help you understand how users in your organization use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and Passwordless authentication.

These reports provide information such as:

- How many users are registered for each authentication method
- How many users are registered for features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR), and Passwordless authentication.
- The failure rates of each authentication method
