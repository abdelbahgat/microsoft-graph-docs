|healthCheckStatusDetails|[cloudPcOnPremisesConnectionStatusDetails](../resources/cloudpconpremisesconnectionstatusdetails.md)|The details of the connection's health checks and the corresponding results. Returned only on `$select`. For an example that shows how to get the **inUse** property, see [Example 2: Get the selected properties of an Azure network connection, including healthCheckStatusDetails](../api/cloudpconpremisesconnection-get.md). Read-only.|
|id|String|Unique identifier for the Azure network connection. Read-only.|
|inUse|Boolean|When `true`, the Azure network connection is in use. When `false`, the connection isn't in use. You can't delete a connection that’s in use. Returned only on `$select`. For an example that shows how to get the **inUse** property, see [Example 2: Get the selected properties of an Azure network connection, including healthCheckStatusDetails](../api/cloudpconpremisesconnection-get.md). Read-only.|

### cloudPcOnPremisesConnectionStatus values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
|pending|Created and waiting for health checks.|
|running|Health checks are running.|
|passed|Health checks notify the customer that the Azure network connection is operating as intended. Customer can provision their Cloud PC without any issue.|
|failed|Health checks notify the customer that the Azure network connection isn't properly configured or functioning. Provisioning fails. The customer needs to identify the issue and resolve it using the guidance provided by Azure network connection for provisioning to be successful.|
|warning|Health checks notify the customer that the Azure network connection isn't configured as per the Microsoft best practice guidance, such as endpoint connectivity. The customer should configure Cloud PC required endpoints before provisioning a Cloud PC. It will not affect the provisioning of the customer's Cloud PC but might affect the customer's experience.|
|informational|Health checks provide information to the customer about current or associated prerequisite checks on Cloud PC add-on features such as Single Sign-On. This won't affect the provisioning of the customer's Cloud PC, but the information is intended to optimize the user experience.|
|unknownFutureValue|Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|
