# requestorManager complex type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Used in the approval settings of an [access package assignment policy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). 
It is a subtype of [userSet](userset.md), in which the `@odata.type` value `#microsoft.graph.requestorManager` indicates that a requesting user's manager is to be the approver.  When creating an access package assignment policy approval stage with requestorManager, also include another approver, such as a single user or group member, in case the requesting user does not have a manager.
