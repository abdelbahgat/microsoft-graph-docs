# userFlowLanguageConfiguration resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

User flows language customization is a feature that allows a given user flow to support customization of multiple languages, from all the built-in languages to a custom language.

For [Azure Active Directory B2C user flows](/azure/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-language-customization#supported-languages), you can leverage the built-in languages or provide the language customizations for a language that is not currently built-in by default. For [Azure Active Directory user flows](/azure/active-directory/external-identities/user-flow-customize-language), you can only leverage the built-in languages provided by Microsoft. Both user flows for Azure Active Directory B2C and Azure Active Directory support customizing the language and strings shown to users as they go through the journeys you configure with your user flows.
