# phoneAuthenticationMethod resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

A representation of a phone registered to a user. This resource includes the phone number, the phone type, and whether the phone is configured for the user to sign in via SMS.

A phone has one of three types: mobile, alternate mobile, or office. A user can have one number registered for each type, and must have a mobile phone before an alternate mobile phone is added. When using a phone for multi-factor authentication (MFA) or self-service password reset (SSPR), the mobile phone is the default and the alternate mobile phone is the backup. 

Mobile phones can be used for both SMS and voice calls, depending on the tenant settings.

An office phone can only receive voice calls, not SMS messages.
