# application resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents an application. Any application that outsources authentication to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) must be registered in a directory. Application registration involves telling Azure AD about your application, including the URL where it's located, the URL to send replies after authentication, the URI to identify your application, and more. For more information, see [Basics of Registering an Application in Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-vs-authorization#basics-of-registering-an-application-in-azure-ad). Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

> [!Note]
> Changes to the application resource type are currently in development. For more information, see [Known issues with Microsoft Graph](/graph/known-issues#application-and-serviceprincipal-api-changes).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

|defaultRedirectUri|String|The default redirect URI. If specified and there is no explicit redirect URI in the sign-in request for SAML and OIDC flows, Azure AD sends the token to this redirect URI. Azure AD also sends the token to this default URI in SAML IdP-initiated single sign-on. The value must match one of the configured redirect URIs for the application.|
| deletedDateTime | DateTimeOffset | The date and time the application was deleted. The DateTimeOffset type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Read-only. |

To set this attribute, use one of the following string values: `None`, `SecurityGroup` (for security groups and Azure AD roles), `All` (this gets all security groups, distribution groups, and Azure AD directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of). |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the application object. This property is referred to as **Object ID** in the Azure portal. Inherited from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md). Key. Not nullable. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `in`). |
| identifierUris | String collection | Also known as App ID URI, this value is set when an application is used as a resource app. The identifierUris acts as the prefix for the scopes you'll reference in your API's code, and it must be globally unique. You can use the default value provided, which is in the form `api://<application-client-id>`, or specify a more readable URI like `https://contoso.com/api`. For more information on valid identifierUris patterns and best practices, see [Azure AD application registration security best practices](/azure/active-directory/develop/security-best-practices-for-app-registration#appid-uri-configuration).

| isDeviceOnlyAuthSupported | Boolean | Specifies whether this application supports device authentication without a user. The default is `false`.  |
| isFallbackPublicClient | Boolean | Specifies the fallback application type as public client, such as an installed application running on a mobile device. The default value is `false` which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as a web app. There are certain scenarios where Azure AD cannot determine the client application type. For example, the [ROPC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) flow where the application is configured without specifying a redirect URI. In those cases Azure AD interprets the application type based on the value of this property.|
| keyCredentials | [keyCredential](keycredential.md) collection | The collection of key credentials associated with the application. Not nullable. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`).|

| requiredResourceAccess |[requiredResourceAccess](requiredresourceaccess.md) collection| Specifies the resources that the application needs to access. This property also specifies the set of delegated permissions and application roles that it needs for each of those resources. This configuration of access to the required resources drives the consent experience. No more than 50 resource services (APIs) can be configured. Beginning mid-October 2021, the total number of required permissions must not exceed 400. Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`).|
| samlMetadataUrl | String | The URL where the service exposes SAML metadata for federation. This property is valid only for single-tenant applications. Nullable. |

| tags |String collection| Custom strings that can be used to categorize and identify the application. Not nullable.<br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`).|
| tokenEncryptionKeyId |Guid|Specifies the keyId of a public key from the keyCredentials collection. When configured, Azure AD encrypts all the tokens it emits by using the key this property points to. The application code that receives the encrypted token must use the matching private key to decrypt the token before it can be used for the signed-in user.|
| verifiedPublisher          | [verifiedPublisher](verifiedPublisher.md)                            | Specifies the verified publisher of the application. For more information about how publisher verification helps support application security, trustworthiness, and compliance, see [Publisher verification](/azure/active-directory/develop/publisher-verification-overview).|
