# signIn resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Provides details about user or application sign-in activity in your directory. You must have a Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 license to download sign-in logs using the Microsoft Graph API.

The availability of sign-in logs is governed by the [Microsoft Entra data retention policies](/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/reference-reports-data-retention#how-long-does-azure-ad-store-the-data).

|[Get signIn](../api/signin-get.md) | [signIn](signin.md) |Read properties and relationships of a signIn object.|
|[Confirm compromised](../api/signin-confirmcompromised.md)|None|Mark an event in the Microsoft Entra sign-in logs as risky.|

|ipAddressFromResourceProvider|String|The IP address a user used to reach a resource provider, used to determine Conditional Access compliance for some policies. For example, when a user interacts with Exchange Online, the IP address that Microsoft Exchange receives from the user can be recorded here. This value is often `null`.|
|isInteractive|Boolean|Indicates whether a user sign in is interactive. In interactive sign in, the user provides an authentication factor to Microsoft Entra ID. These factors include passwords, responses to MFA challenges, biometric factors, or QR codes that a user provides to Microsoft Entra ID or an associated app. In non-interactive sign in, the user doesn't provide an authentication factor. Instead, the client app uses a token or code to authenticate or access a resource on behalf of a user.
