# administrativeUnit resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

An administrative unit provides a conceptual container for user, group, and device directory objects. Using administrative units, a company administrator can now delegate administrative responsibilities to manage the users, groups, and devices contained within or scoped to an administrative unit to a regional or departmental administrator. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/administrativeunit-delta.md) function. 

Let's look at an example. Imagine that Contoso Corp is made up of two divisions - a West Coast Division and an East Coast Division. Directory roles at Contoso are scoped to the entire tenant. Lee, a Contoso company administrator, wants to delegate administrative responsibilities, but scope them to the West Coast Division or the East Coast division.  Lee can create a *West Coast admistrative unit* and place all West Coast users into this administrative unit.  Similarly, Lee can create an *East Coast adminstrative unit*.  Now Lee, can start delegating administrative responsibilities to others, but **scoped** to the new administrative units he's created. Lee places Jennifer in a *helpdesk administrator* role **scoped** to the *West Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Jennifer to reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *West Coast administrative unit*.  Similarly, Lee places Dave in a *user account administrator* role **scoped** to the *East Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Dave to update users, assign licenses and reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *East Coast administrative unit*. For a video overview, please see [Introduction to Azure Active Directory Administrative Units](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-Azure-Active-Directory/Introduction-to-Azure-Active-Directory-Administrative-Units).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

> [!NOTE]
> The URL endpoint for calling the **administrativeUnits** API is `/administrativeUnits` in the `beta` endpoint but `/directory/administrativeUnits` in the `v1.0` endpoint.

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#administrative-unit-properties).

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|An optional description for the administrative unit. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `in`, `startsWith`), `$search`.|
|displayName|String|Display name for the administrative unit. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderBy`.|
|id|String|Unique identifier for the administrative unit. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`).|
| membershipRule | String | Dynamic membership rule for the administrative unit. For more about the rules that you can use for dynamic administrative units and dynamic groups, see [Using attributes to create advanced rules](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-accessmanagement-groups-with-advanced-rules/). |
| membershipRuleProcessingState | String | Used to control whether the dynamic membership rule is actively processed. Set to `On` when you want the dynamic membership rule to be active and `Paused` if you want to stop updating membership dynamically. If not set, the default behavior is `Paused`. |
| membershipType | String | Membership type for the administrative unit. Can be `dynamic` or `assigned`. If not set, the default behavior is `assigned`. |
| visibility | String | Controls whether the administrative unit and its members are hidden or public. Can be set to `HiddenMembership` or `Public`. If not set, the default behavior is `Public`. When set to `HiddenMembership`, only members of the administrative unit can list other members of the administrative unit. |

> [!TIP]
> Directory extensions and associated data are returned by default while schema extensions and associated data returned only on `$select`.

## Relationships
| Relationship | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|extensions|[extension](extension.md) collection|The collection of open extensions defined for this administrative unit. Nullable.|
|members|[directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection|Users and groups that are members of this administrative unit. Supports `$expand`.|
|scopedRoleMembers|[scopedRoleMembership](scopedrolemembership.md) collection| Scoped-role members of this administrative unit.|
