# Microsoft Entra policy overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Entra ID uses policies to control Microsoft Entra feature behaviors in your organization. Policies are custom rules that you can enforce on applications, service principals, groups, or on the entire organization they are assigned to.
