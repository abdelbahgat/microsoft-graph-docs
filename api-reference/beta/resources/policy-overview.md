# Azure AD policy overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) uses policies to control Azure AD feature behaviors in your organization. Policies are custom rules that you can enforce on applications, service principals, groups, or on the entire organization they are assigned to.

## What policies are available?
