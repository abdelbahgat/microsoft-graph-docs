# audioRoutingGroup resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The audio routing group stores a private audio route between participants in a multiparty conversation. Source is the participant itself and the receivers are a subset of other participants in the multiparty conversation.

> **Note:** [ConfigureMixer](../api/participant-configuremixer.md) does not involve any routes, it is for the entire call for setting the volume levels for source-receiver combinations.

## Methods

| Method                                                  | Return Type                               | Description                                  |

## Properties

| Property      | Type              | Description                                                          |
| :----------   | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id            | string            | Read-only.                                                           |
| receivers     | collection(string) | List of receiving participant ids.                                   |
| routingMode   | string            | Routing group mode.  Possible values are: `oneToOne`, `multicast`.   |
| sources       | collection(string) | List of source participant ids.                                      |

> **Note:** Routing mode determines the restrictions on the sources and receivers. Only the following routing groups are supported.
> - `oneToOne` - sources and receivers have only one participant each.
> - `multicast` - source has one participant but there are multiple receivers. Receivers list may be updated.

> **Note:** If you create many audio routing groups (e.g. a bot per participant), only the audio of the top 4 dominant speakers is forwarded. It means even with customized audio routing group, if the speaker is not loud enough in the main mixer, he/she cannot be heard by the bot even if there is a private audio group just for this speaker and the bot.
