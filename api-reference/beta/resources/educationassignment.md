# educationAssignment resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a task or unit of work assigned to a student or team member in a class as part of their study. 

Only teachers or team owners can create **assignments**. **Assignments** contain handouts and tasks that the teacher wants the student to work on. Each student **assignment** has an associated [submission](educationsubmissionresource.md) that contains any work their teacher asked to be turned in. A teacher can add scores and feedback to the **submission** turned in by the student.

When an **assignment** is created, it is in a Draft state. Students can't see the **assignment** and **submissions** won't be created. You can change the status of an **assignment** by using the [publish](../api/educationassignment-publish.md) action. You can't use a PATCH request to change the **assignment** status.

The **assignment** APIs are exposed in the class namespace.
