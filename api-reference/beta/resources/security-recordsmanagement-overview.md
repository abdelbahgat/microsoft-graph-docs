# Use the Microsoft Graph records management APIs

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft Purview records management APIs help organizations manage retention and deletion of data to meet their legal obligations and compliance regulations, and increases efficiency by enabling the regular disposition of items that no longer have to be retained.

The records management solution is a part of the Microsoft Purview compliance center.

## Manage retention labels
Records management admins and developers need to maintain records management systems with labels that are created, updated, and deleted periodically.

Developers and compliance admins can use the records management APIs to perform operations on records management labels in order to maintain their systems.

## Trigger events for an existing label
When an employee leaves a company, information is updated in the HR management system. From the leave date, confidential documents need to be retained for a period for 7 years. These documents have the label `Employee_departure` applied.

Developers and compliance administrators can use records management APIs to read the label `Employee_departure` and look up the associated event type `Event-employee_departure`.

Compliance admins can use records management APIs to create an event for the associated event type. The retention period for the confidential documents starts after the creation of this event.

## Entities
The records management API includes the following key entities.

| Name | Type       | Use case |
|:-|:-|:-|
| Label | [microsoft.graph.security.retentionLabel](../resources/security-retentionlabel.md) | Contains retention settings and actions that can be applied to an item at the end of a period. |
| Retention event | [microsoft.graph.security.retentionEvent](../resources/security-retentionevent.md) | Represents a trigger for event-based retention, where a retention period starts after the event occurs. |
| Retention event type | [microsoft.graph.security.retentionEventType](../resources/security-retentioneventtype.md) | Represents a single group for the same type of retention events. |
