# fileThreatSubmission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.security

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a threat submission related to a file. It's used to submit suspected malware email attachments to Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It could also be used to submit false positive cases that shouldn't have been blocked by Microsoft Defender for Office 365, for example, a safe email attachment.

Currently, file threat submission is routed to Microsoft Defender for Office 365. In future, it may be routed to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This is a unified interface for file threat submission no matter where it's routed to.

This is an abstract type. Inherits from [threatSubmission](../resources/security-threatsubmission.md).
