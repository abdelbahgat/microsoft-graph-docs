# workflow resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph.identityGovernance

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents workflows created using Lifecycle Workflows. Workflows, when triggered by execution conditions, automate parts of the lifecycle management process using tasks. These tasks can either be built-in tasks, or a custom task can be called using the custom task extension which integrate with Azure Logic Apps.

You can create up to 50 workflows in a tenant.

Inherits from [workflowBase](../resources/identitygovernance-workflowbase.md).
