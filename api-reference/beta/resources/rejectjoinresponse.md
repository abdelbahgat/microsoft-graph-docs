# rejectJoinResponse resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Contains a response to reject a participant who tries to join the meeting.

This has the same effect as rejecting a policy recording incoming call notification using the [reject-call](../api/call-reject.md) method. The bot will continue to receive a participant joining notification for a new user joining until its capacity has been reached.
