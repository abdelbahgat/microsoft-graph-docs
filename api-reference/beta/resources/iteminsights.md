# itemInsights resource type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Relationships between a user and items such as OneDrive for Business documents, calculated using advanced analytics and machine learning techniques. You can, for example, identify OneDrive for Business documents trending around users. Derived from [officeGraphInsights](officegraphinsights.md).

Insights are returned by the following APIs:

- [Trending](insights-trending.md) - returns documents from OneDrive for Business and from SharePoint sites trending around a user.
- [Used](insights-used.md) - returns documents viewed and modified by a user. Includes documents the user used in OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint.
- [Shared](insights-shared.md) - returns documents shared with a user. Documents can be shared as email attachments or as OneDrive for Business links sent in emails.

Each insight is returned with a `resourceVisualization` and `resourceReference` complex value type (CVT). The resourceVisualization CVT contains properties such as `title` and `previewImageUrl`. Microsoft uses the visualization properties to render the files in experiences like Office Delve.

### Limiting item insights

Update [insightsSettings](insightssettings.md) to disable item insights for a specific Azure AD group or an entire organization. For more details, see [customize insights privacy](/graph/insights-customize-item-insights-privacy).
