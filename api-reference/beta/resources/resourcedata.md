# resourceData resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents the resource data attached to the change notification sent to the subscriber. This resource is an open type and allows other properties to be passed in.

For details, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API to get change notifications](webhooks.md).

## Methods

None.

## Properties

None except for Outlook resources where **resourceData** contains the following fields:

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:------------|

| @odata.id | String | The OData identifier of the object. |
| @odata.etag | String | The HTTP entity tag that represents the version of the object. |
| id | String | The identifier of the object. |

> **Note:** The **id** value provided in **resourceData** is valid at the time the change notification was generated. Some actions, such as moving a message to another folder, might result in the `id` no longer being valid when the change notification is processed.
