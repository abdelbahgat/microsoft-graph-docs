# contentType: getCompatibleHubContentTypes
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of compatible content types from the content type hub that can be added to a target [site](../resources/site.md) or a [list](../resources/list.md).

This method is part of the content type publishing changes to optimize the syncing of published content types to sites and lists, effectively switching from a "push everywhere" to "pull as needed" approach. The method allows users to pull content types directly from the content type hub to a site or list. For more information, see [contentType: addCopyFromContentTypeHub](contenttype-addcopyfromcontenttypehub.md) and the blog post [Syntex Product Updates â€“ August 2021](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sharepoint-syntex-blog/syntex-product-updates-august-2021/ba-p/2606438).
