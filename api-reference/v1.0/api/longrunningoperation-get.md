# Get longRunningOperation

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Retrieve the status of a long-running operation, represented by a [longRunningOperation](../resources/longrunningoperation.md) object. A long-running operation is initiated when you [reset a user's password](authenticationmethod-resetpassword.md). This resource type is also the base type for the richLongRunningOperation object that represents the status of a long-running operation on a [site](../resources/site.md) or a [list](../resources/list.md).

The possible states of the long-running operation are `notStarted`, `running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `unknownFutureValue` where `succeeded` and `failed` are terminal states.
