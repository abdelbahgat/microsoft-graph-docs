# Delete schemaExtension

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete the definition of a [schema extension](../resources/schemaextension.md). Only the app that created the schema extension (owner app) can delete the schema extension definition, and only when the extension is in the `InDevelopment` state. Deleting a schema extension definition does not affect accessing custom data that has been added to resource instances based on that definition.
