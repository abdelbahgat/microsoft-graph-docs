# List group owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of the group's owners. The owners are a set of users or service principals who are allowed to modify the group object. Owners are currently not available in Microsoft Graph for groups that were created in Exchange or groups that are synchronized from an on-premises environment.

> **Note:** Currently, service principals are not listed as group owners due to the staged rollout of service principals to the Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/owners
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the group owners that are users. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description               |
| :------------ | :----- | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | string | Bearer {token}. Required. |
