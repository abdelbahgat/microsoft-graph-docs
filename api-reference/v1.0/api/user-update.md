# Update user

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the properties of a [user](../resources/user.md) object. Not all properties can be updated by Member or Guest users with their default permissions without Administrator roles. [Compare member and guest default permissions](/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/users-default-permissions?context=graph/context#compare-member-and-guest-default-permissions) to see properties they can manage.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite, User.ManageIdentities.All, User.EnableDisableAccount.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.ReadWrite    |
|Application | User.ManageIdentities.All, User.EnableDisableAccount.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

>[!NOTE]
> - To update sensitive user properties, such as **accountEnabled**, **mobilePhone**, and **otherMails** for users with privileged administrator roles, the app must be assigned the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission, and the calling user must have a higher privileged administrator role as indicated in [Who can perform sensitive actions](../resources/users.md#who-can-perform-sensitive-actions).
> - Your personal Microsoft account must be tied to an Azure AD tenant to update your profile with the *User.ReadWrite* delegated permission on a personal Microsoft account.
> - Updating the **identities** property requires the *User.ManageIdentities.All* permission. Also, adding a [B2C local account](../resources/objectidentity.md) to an existing **user** object is not allowed, unless the **user** object already contains a local account identity.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /users/{id | userPrincipalName}
```

## Request headers
| Header       | Value|
|:-----------|:------|

## Request body

|interests|String collection|A list for the user to describe their interests.|
|jobTitle|String|The user's job title.|
|mail|String|The SMTP address for the user, for example, `jeff@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`.

|mailNickname|String|The mail alias for the user. This property must be specified when a user is created.|
|mobilePhone|String|The primary cellular telephone number for the user.|

The password in the profile must satisfy minimum requirements as specified by the **passwordPolicies** property. By default, a strong password is required. As a best practice, always set the **forceChangePasswordNextSignIn** to `true`. This cannot be used for federated users. <br><br> In delegated access, the calling app must be assigned the *Directory.AccessAsUser.All* delegated permission on behalf of the signed-in user. In application-only access, the calling app must be assigned the *User.ReadWrite.All* application permission and at least the *User Administrator* [Azure AD role](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference?toc=%2Fgraph%2Ftoc.json).|
