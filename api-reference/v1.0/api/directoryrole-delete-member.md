# Remove directory role member

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Remove a member from a [directoryRole](../resources/directoryrole.md).

You can use both the object ID and template ID of the **directoryRole** with this API. The template ID of a built-in role is immutable and can be seen in the role description on the Azure portal. For details, see [Role template IDs](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#role-template-ids).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory |

## HTTP request

You can address the directory role using either its **id** or **roleTemplateId**.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /directoryRoles/{role-id}/members/{id}/$ref
DELETE /directoryRoles(roleTemplateId='{roleTemplateId}')/members/{id}/$ref
```
> [!CAUTION]
> If `/$ref` is not appended to the request and the calling app has permissions to manage the member object, the object will also be deleted from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD); otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` error is returned. You can restore specific objects through the [Restore deleted items API](directory-deleteditems-restore.md).

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.
