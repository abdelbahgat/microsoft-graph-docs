## HTTP request


<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } --> 

```http
GET /reports/getYammerActivityUserDetail(period='{period_value}')
GET /reports/getYammerActivityUserDetail(date={date_value})
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide one of the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: D7, D30, D90, and D180. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

| :------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.                |

The CSV file has the following headers for columns.

- Report Refresh Date
- User Principal Name
- Display Name
- User State
- State Change Date
- Last Activity Date
- Posted Count
- Read Count
- Liked Count
- Assigned Products
