# List applications

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the list of [applications](../resources/application.md) in this organization.

> [!NOTE]
> When calling this API using tokens issued for a personal Microsoft account, it will return the apps owned by the personal Microsoft account. The notion of organizations doesn't exist for personal Microsoft accounts. To list applications owned by a specific personal Microsoft account, this API requires the *User.Read* permission in addition to *Application.Read.All* or *Application.ReadWrite.All*.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application.Read.All and User.Read, Application.ReadWrite.All and User.Read |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

[!INCLUDE [permissions-applicationreadwriteownedby-disclaimer](../../includes/permissions-applicationreadwriteownedby-disclaimer.md)]

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /applications
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. Some relationships also support `$filter`. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 application objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

By default, this API doesn't return the value of the **key** in the **keyCredentials** property when listing all applications. To retrieve the public key info in **key**, the **keyCredentials** property must be specified in a `$select` query. For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for applications has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [application](../resources/application.md) objects in the response body.

{
  "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#applications",
  "value": [
    {
      "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

    }
  ]
}
```

### Example 2: Get only a count of applications

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` because `$count` is in the request. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored",
  "name": "get_count_only"
}-->
```msgraph-interactive
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/applications/$count
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

#### Response

The following is an example of the response.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: text/plain

893
```


### Example 3: Use $filter and $top to get one application with a display name that starts with 'a' including a count of returned objects

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. This request requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string because the request has both the `$orderBy` and `$filter` query parameters. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

>**Note:** The `$count` and `$search` query parameters are currently not available in Azure AD B2C tenants.
