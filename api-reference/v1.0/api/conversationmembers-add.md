```

## Request headers

| :------------ | :------------------------ |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the JSON representation of the list of `conversationMember` derivatives that need to be added to the team. A maximum of 200 `conversationMember` derivatives can be added in one single request.

The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this action.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|values|[conversationMember](../resources/conversationmember.md) collection|List of conversation members that should be added.|


## Response

If successful, this action returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of derivatives of [actionResultPart](../resources/actionresultpart.md) in the response body.

This API returns a `200` response that indicates all members supplied were added to the team or a `207` response that indicates only some of the supplied members were added to the team. The caller should inspect the response payload to determine which member additions failed. The response body is a collection of derivatives of the [actionResultPart](../resources/actionresultpart.md) resource.
