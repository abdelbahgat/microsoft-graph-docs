# Create group

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new group as specified in the request body. You can create the following types of groups:

- Microsoft 365 group (unified group)
- Security group

This operation returns by default only a subset of the properties for each group. These default properties are noted in the [Properties](../resources/group.md#properties) section.

To get properties that are _not_ returned by default, do a [GET operation](group-get.md) and specify the properties in a `$select` OData query option.

> **Note**: Although Microsoft Teams is built on Microsoft 365 groups, you can't currently create a team via this API. You can use the other group APIs to manage a team that has been created in the Microsoft Teams UI.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                |
| :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All               |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                             |
| Application                            | Group.Create, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

For an app create a group with owners or members while it has the *Group.Create* permission, the app must have the privileges to read the object type that it wants to assign as the group owner or member. Therefore:
+ The app can assign itself as the group's owner or member.
+ To create the group with users as owners or members, the app must have at least the *User.Read.All* permission.
+ To create the group with other service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Application.Read.All* permission.
+ To create the group with either users or service principals as owners or members, the app must have at least the *Directory.Read.All* permission.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Creating a group using the **Group.Create** application permission without specifying owners will create the group anonymously and the group will not be modifiable. Add owners to the group while creating it to specify owners who can modify the group.
>
> - Creating a Microsoft 365 group programmatically with an app-only context and without specifying owners will create the group anonymously. Doing so can result in the associated SharePoint Online site not being created automatically until further manual action is taken.
>
> - To following properties can't be set in the initial POST request and must be set in a subsequent PATCH request: **allowExternalSenders**, **autoSubscribeNewMembers**, **hideFromAddressLists**, **hideFromOutlookClients**, **isSubscribedByMail**, **unseenCount**.

### groupTypes options

Use the **groupTypes** property to control the type of group and its membership, as shown.

| Type of group                     | Assigned membership | Dynamic membership                |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| Microsoft 365 (aka unified group) | `["Unified"]`       | `["Unified","DynamicMembership"]` |
| Dynamic                           | `[]` (_null_)       | `["DynamicMembership"]`           |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body. The response includes only the default properties of the group.

## Examples

### Example 1: Create a Microsoft 365 group

The following example creates a Microsoft 365 group. Because the owners have not been specified, the calling user is automatically added as the owner of the group.

### Example 3: Create a Microsoft 365 group that can be assigned to an Azure AD role

#### Request

The following is an example of the request. The calling user must be assigned the _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_ permission to set the **isAssignableToRole** property or update the membership of such groups.

A group with **isAssignableToRole** property set to `true` cannot be of dynamic membership type, its **securityEnabled** must be set to `true`, and **visibility** can only be `Private`.
