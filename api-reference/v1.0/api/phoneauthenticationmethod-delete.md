# Delete phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Delete a user's [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md). This removes the phone number from the user and they will no longer be able to use the number for authentication, whether via SMS or voice calls.

A user cannot have an `alternateMobile` number without a `mobile` number. If you want to remove a `mobile` number from a user that also has an `alternateMobile` number, first [update](phoneauthenticationmethod-update.md) the `mobile` number to the new number, then delete the `alternateMobile` number.

If the phone number is the user's default Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) authentication method, it cannot be deleted. Have the user change their default authentication method, and then delete the number.
