# Get sharing permission for a file or folder

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return the effective sharing permission for a particular permission resource.

Effective permissions of an item can come from two sources: permissions set directly on the item itself or permissions that are inherited from the item's ancestors.

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the `inheritedFrom` property.
This property is an [ItemReference](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.Read, Files.ReadWrite, Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.Read.All, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

<!-- {"blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "truncated": true} -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "@deprecated.GrantedTo": "GrantedTo has been deprecated. Refer to GrantedToV2",
  "grantedTo": {
    "user": {
      "displayName": "Robin Danielsen",
      "id": "efee1b77-fb3b-4f65-99d6-274c11914d12"
    }
  },

}
```

## Remarks

The [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resource uses _facets_ to provide information about the kind of permission represented by the resource.

Permissions with a [**link**](../resources/sharinglink.md) facet represent sharing links created on the item. 
Sharing links contain a unique token that provides access to the item for anyone with the link.

Permissions with a [**invitation**](../resources/sharinginvitation.md) facet represent permissions added by inviting specific users or groups to have access to the file.
