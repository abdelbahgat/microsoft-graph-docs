# List associatedTeamInfo
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the list of [teams](../resources/associatedteaminfo.md) in Microsoft Teams that a [user](../resources/user.md) is associated with.
Currently, a [user](../resources/user.md) can be associated with a [team](../resources/team.md) in two different ways:
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a direct member of a [team](../resources/team.md).
* A [user](../resources/user.md) can be a member of a shared [channel](../resources/channel.md) that is hosted inside a [team](../resources/team.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type|Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:---|:---|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Team.ReadBasic.All, TeamSettings.Read.All, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All|

> **Note:** Currently, with user delegated permissions, this operation only works for the `me` user. With application permissions, it works for all users by specifying the specific user ID (`me` alias is not supported with application permissions).
