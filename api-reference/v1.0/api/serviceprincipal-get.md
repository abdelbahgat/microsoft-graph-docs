# Get servicePrincipal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) object.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Directory.Read.All |

> [!NOTE]
> A service principal can retrieve its own application and service principal details without being granted any application permissions.
> The *Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy* permission allows an app to call `GET /applications` and `GET /servicePrincipals` to list all applications and service principals in the tenant. This scope of access has been allowed for the permission.


## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /servicePrincipals/{id}
GET /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

By default, this API doesn't return the public key value of the **key** in the **keyCredentials** property unless **keyCredentials** is specified in a `$select` query.
For example, `$select=id,appId,keyCredentials`.

The use of `$select` to get **keyCredentials** for service principals has a throttling limit of 150 requests per minute for every tenant.

## Request headers
| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Accept-Language| Language code. Optional.   |

Providing the **Accept-Language** header with a supported language code, such as `es-ES` or `de-DE`, will return localized values where available. Note that the header is not supported for [list operations](serviceprincipal-list.md).

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) object in the response body.
