# List group transitive members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the group's members. A group can have different object types as members. For more information about supported member types for different groups, see [Group membership](../resources/groups-overview.md#group-membership).

This operation is transitive and returns a flat list of all nested members. An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                                           |
| Application                            | GroupMember.Read.All, Group.Read.All, GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

> **Note:** To list the members of a hidden membership group, the _Member.Read.Hidden_ permission is required.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/transitiveMembers
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, `$top`, and `$filter`. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** and **description** properties. When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

This API returns up to 100 member objects by default. The maximum page size that you can request through the `$top` query parameter is 999 objects.

To filter the results on the OData type, such as `microsoft.graph.user` or `microsoft.graph.group`, you must use the [advanced query parameters](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). That is, the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and the `$count=true` query string.

## Request headers

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization    | Bearer {token}. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

 An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/transitiveMembers/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group will return this error, because Microsoft 365 groups cannot have other groups as members.
