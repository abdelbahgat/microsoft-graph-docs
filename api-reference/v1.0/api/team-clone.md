# team: clone

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a copy of a [team](../resources/team.md). This operation also creates a copy of the corresponding [group](../resources/group.md).
You can specify which parts of the team to clone:

- **apps** - Copies Microsoft Teams apps that are installed in the team.
- **channels** – Copies the channel structure (but not the messages in the channel).
- **members** – Copies the members and owners of the group.
- **settings** – Copies all settings within the team, along with key group settings.
- **tabs** – Copies the tabs within channels.

> **Note:** This method isn't supported for organization-wide teams.

> [!NOTE]
> A known issue related to owners of cloned teams is associated with this method. For details, see [Known issues](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/&search=18955).

When tabs are cloned, they aren't configured. The tabs are displayed on the tab bar in Microsoft Teams, and the first time a user opens them, they must go through the configuration screen. 
If the user who opens the tab doesn't have permission to configure apps, they'll see a message that says that the tab isn't configured.

Cloning is a long-running operation. After the POST clone returns, you need to GET the [operation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md) returned by the `Location:` header to see if it's `running`, `succeeded`, or `failed`. You should continue to GET until the status isn't `running`. The recommended delay between GETs is 5 seconds.
