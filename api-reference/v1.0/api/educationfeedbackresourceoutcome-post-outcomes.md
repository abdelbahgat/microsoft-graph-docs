# Create educationFeedbackResourceOutcome

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [feedback resource](../resources/educationfeedbackresourceoutcome.md) for a submission. Only a teacher can perform this operation.

To create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the feedback resources folder associated with the assignment. If the file doesn't exist or isn't in that folder, the `POST` request will fail.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can upload an assignment feedback resource, you must [set up the feedback resources folder](../api/educationassignment-setupfeedbackresourcesfolder.md) for the [educationAssignment](../resources/educationassignment.md) to upload the files to.
