### Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object in the response body.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "id": "opaqueId-fj3hd7yf283jfk193726nvc2w3i2diemdu8",
  "notificationUrl": "https://f3hb0mpua.svc.ms/zbaehwg/callback?snthgk=1ff3-2345672zz831837523"
}
```

The `notificationUrl` returned is a socket.io endpoint URL.

The following example shows how to use the `notificationUrl` with socket.io in JavaScript.

```javascript
// this is the notificationUrl returned from this API
var notificationUrl = "https://f3hb0mpua.svc.ms/zbaehwg/callback?snthgk=1ff3-2345672zz831837523";

// 'io' comes from the socket.io client library
var socket = io(notificationUrl);

// these examples log to the console.
// your app would provide its own callbacks
socket.on("connect", ()=>console.log("Connected!"));
socket.on("notification", (data)=>console.log("Notification!", data));
```
