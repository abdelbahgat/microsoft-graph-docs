# Add owners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a user or service principal to a Microsoft 365 or security group's owners. The owners are a set of users or service principals who are allowed to modify the group object.

> **Important:** If you update the group owners and you created a team for the group, it can take up to 2 hours for the owners to be synchronized with Microsoft Teams. Also, if you want the owner to be able to make changes in a team - for example, by creating a Planner plan - the owner also needs to be added as a group/team member.
