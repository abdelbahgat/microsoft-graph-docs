[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

## HTTP request

```http
GET /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members
GET /directory/administrativeUnits/{id}/members/$ref
```

## Optional query parameters
This method (when used without `$ref`) supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, including `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter`. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the users that are a member of the administrative unit. 

`$search` is supported on the **displayName** and **description** properties only. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| ConsistencyLevel  | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using `$search`, or in specific usage of `$filter`. For more information about the use of **ConsistencyLevel** and `$count`, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries). |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [user](../resources/user.md), [group](../resources/group.md), or [device](../resources/device.md) objects in the response body. Adding `$ref` at the end of the request returns a collection of only `@odata.id` URLs of the members.
