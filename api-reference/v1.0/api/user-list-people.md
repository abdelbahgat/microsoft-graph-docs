Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a collection of [person](../resources/person.md) objects ordered by their relevance to the [user](../resources/user.md), which is determined by the user's communication and collaboration patterns, and business relationships.

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | People.Read, People.Read.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | People.Read    |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response, as shown in the examples in the article [Get relevant information about people](/graph/people-example).

|Name|Value|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:-------|
|$filter|string|Limits the response to only those people whose record contains the specified criteria.|
|$orderby|string|By default the people in the response are sorted by their relevance to your query. You can change the order of the people in the response using the *$orderby* parameter.|
|$search|string|Search for people by name or alias. Supports Fuzzy matching. Parameter only works for searching the signed-in user's relevant people, not for searching people relevant to other users. Also supports the `topic` keyword to find people based on topics extracted from e-mail conversations with that person. See the *Perform a fuzzy search* section at [Get relevant information about people](/graph/people-example#perform-a-fuzzy-search) for information and examples. |
|$select|string|Comma-separated list of properties to include in the response. For optimal performance, only select the subset of properties needed.|
|$skip|int|Skip the first n results, useful for paging. This is not supported when using *$search*.|
|$top|int|Number of results to be returned.|

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
