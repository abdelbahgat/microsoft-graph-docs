# List registeredOwners

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of users that are registered owners of the device. A registered owner is the user that cloud joined the device or registered their personal device. The registered owner is set at the time of registration. Currently, there can be only one owner.

## HTTP request

You can address the device using either its **id** or **deviceId**.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/{id}/registeredOwners
GET /devices(deviceId='{deviceId}')/registeredOwners
```
## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the device is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|

## Request body
