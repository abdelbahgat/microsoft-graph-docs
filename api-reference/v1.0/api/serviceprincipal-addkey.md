# servicePrincipal: addKey

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Adds a key credential to a [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md). This method along with [removeKey](serviceprincipal-removekey.md) can be used by a servicePrincipal to automate rolling its expiring keys.

> [!NOTE]
> [Create servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-post-serviceprincipals.md) and
[Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) operations can continue to be used to add and update key credentials for any servicePrincipal with or without a user's context.

As part of the request validation for this method, a proof of possession of an existing key is verified before the action can be performed. 

ServicePrincipals that don’t have any existing valid certificates (i.e.: no certificates have been added yet, or all certificates have expired), won’t be able to use this service action. [Update servicePrincipal](../api/serviceprincipal-update.md) can be used to perform an update instead.

## Request headers

| Name           | Description                |
|:---------------|:---------------------------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type   | application/json. Required.|

## Request body

In the request body, provide the following required properties.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| keyCredential | [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) | The new servicePrincipal key credential to add. The __type__, __usage__ and __key__ are required properties for this usage. Supported key types are:<br><ul><li>`AsymmetricX509Cert`: The usage must be `Verify`.</li><li>`X509CertAndPassword`: The usage must be `Sign`</li></ul>|
| passwordCredential | [passwordCredential](../resources/passwordcredential.md) | Only __secretText__ is required to be set which should contain the password for the key. This property is required only for keys of type `X509CertAndPassword`. Set it to `null` otherwise.|
| proof | String | A self-signed JWT token used as a proof of possession of the existing keys. This JWT token must be signed using the private key of one of the servicePrincipal's existing valid certificates. The token should contain the following claims:<ul><li>`aud` - Audience needs to be `00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000`.</li><li>`iss` - Issuer needs to be the __id__  of the servicePrincipal that is making the call.</li><li>`nbf` - Not before time.</li><li>`exp` - Expiration time should be "nbf" + 10 mins.</li></ul><br>Here is a code [sample](/graph/application-rollkey-prooftoken) that can be used to generate this proof of possession token.|


## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a new [keyCredential](../resources/keycredential.md) object in the response body.
