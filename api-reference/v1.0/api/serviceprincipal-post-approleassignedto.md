# Grant an appRoleAssignment for a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Assign an app role for a resource service principal, to a user, group, or client service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly with app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

To grant an app role assignment, you need three identifiers:

- `principalId`: The `id` of the **user**, **group** or client **servicePrincipal** to which you are assigning the app role.
- `resourceId`: The `id` of the resource **servicePrincipal** which has defined the app role.
- `appRoleId`: The `id` of the **appRole** (defined on the resource service principal) to assign to a user, group, or service principal.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
