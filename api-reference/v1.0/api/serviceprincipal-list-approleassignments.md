# List appRoleAssignments granted to a service principal

Namespace: microsoft.graph


Retrieve the list of [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that have been granted to a service principal.

App roles that are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Application permissions can be granted directly by creating app role assignments, or through a [consent experience](/azure/active-directory/develop/application-consent-experience).

>**Note** This request might have replication delays for app role assignments that were recently granted or removed.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Directory.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Directory.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

[!INCLUDE [permissions-applicationreadwriteownedby-disclaimer](../../includes/permissions-applicationreadwriteownedby-disclaimer.md)]
