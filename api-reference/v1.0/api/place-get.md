# Get place

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the properties and relationships of a [place](../resources/place.md) object specified by either its ID or email address.

The **place** object can be one of the following types:

* A [room](../resources/room.md) which includes rich properties such as an email address for the room, and accessibility, capacity, and device support.
* A [room list](../resources/roomlist.md) which includes an email address for the room list, and a navigation property to get the collection of **room** instances in that room list.

Both **room** and **roomList** are derived from the [place](../resources/place.md) object.
