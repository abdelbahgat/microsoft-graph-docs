# directoryObject: getByIds

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Return the directory objects specified in a list of IDs.

>[!NOTE]
>This API has a [known issue](/graph/known-issues#incomplete-objects-when-using-getbyids-request). Not all directory objects returned are the full objects containing all their properties.

Some common uses for this function are to:

* Resolve IDs returned by functions (that return collections of IDs) such as [getMemberObjects](directoryobject-getmemberobjects.md) or [getMemberGroups](directoryobject-getmembergroups.md)  to their backing directory objects.
* Resolve IDs persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.
