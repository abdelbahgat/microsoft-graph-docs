# Get channel

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [channel](../resources/channel.md).

This method supports federation. Only a user who is a member of the shared channel can retrieve channel information.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All**, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.Read.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | ChannelSettings.Read.Group*, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.Group*, Channel.ReadBasic.All, ChannelSettings.Read.All, ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.Read.All**, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.Read.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

[!INCLUDE [teamwork-permissions-note](../../../includes/teamwork-permissions-note.md)]

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /teams/{team-id}/channels/{channel-id}
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter` and `$select` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

### Use $select for better performance

Populating the **email** and **summary** property for a channel is an expensive operation that results in slow performance. Use `$select` to exclude the **email** and **summary** property to improve performance.

> **Note**: The summary property can only be retrieved via the `select` parameter, as shown in Example 2 in this topic.

## Request headers

| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [channel](../resources/channel.md) object in the response body.
