# List temporaryAccessPassMethods
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of a user's [temporaryAccessPassAuthenticationMethod](../resources/temporaryaccesspassauthenticationmethod.md) objects and their properties. This API will only return a single object in the collection as a user can have only one Temporary Access Pass method.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### Permissions acting on self

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | Not supported. |

### Permissions acting on other users

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:---------------------------------------|:-------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | UserAuthenticationMethod.Read.All, UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All |


For delegated scenarios where an admin is acting on another user, the admin needs one of the following [roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles):

* Global administrator
* Global reader
* Privileged authentication administrator
* Authentication administrator
