# List group members

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get a list of the group's direct members. A group can have users, organizational contacts, devices, service principals and other groups as members. This operation is not transitive.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API has a known issue where service principals are not listed as group members in v1.0. Use this API on the `beta` endpoint instead or the `/groups/{id}?$expand=members` API. Note the [limitations of $expand on directory objects](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/known-issues/?search=13635).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /groups/{id}/members
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$count`, `$select`, `$search`, `$top`, `$search`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. The default and maximum page sizes are 100 and 999 group objects respectively. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

OData cast is also enabled. For example, `/groups/{id}}/members/microsoft.graph.user` retrives group members that are users.

## Request headers

| Header           | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Authorization    | Bearer {token}. Required.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ConsistencyLevel | eventual. This header and `$count` are required when using the `$search`, `$filter`, `$orderby`, or OData cast query parameters. It uses an index that might not be up-to-date with recent changes to the object. |

## Request body

Don't supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.

An attempt to filter by an OData cast that represents an unsupported member type returns a `400 Bad Request` error with the `Request_UnsupportedQuery` code. For example, `/groups/{id}}/members/microsoft.graph.group` when the group is a Microsoft 365 group will return this error, because Microsoft 365 groups cannot have other groups as members.
