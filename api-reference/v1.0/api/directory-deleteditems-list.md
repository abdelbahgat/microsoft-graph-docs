# List deletedItems (directory objects)

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Retrieve a list of recently deleted directory objects. Currently, this functionality is only supported for the [application](../resources/application.md), [group](../resources/group.md), and [user](../resources/user.md) resources.

Currently, deleted items functionality is only supported for the [application](../resources/application.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [group](../resources/group.md), and [user](../resources/user.md) resources.

>**Note:** Deleted security groups are deleted permanently and can't be retrieved through this API.

## Permissions

[!INCLUDE [limited-info](../../includes/limited-info.md)]

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

### For applications and service principals:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.Read.All, Application.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

### For users:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | User.Read.All, User.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

### For groups:

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http 
GET /directory/deleteditems/microsoft.graph.application
GET /directory/deleteditems/microsoft.graph.servicePrincipal
GET /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.group
GET /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.user
GET /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.device
```

This API currently supports retrieving object types of applications (`microsoft.graph.application`), servicePrincipals (`microsoft.graph.serviceprincipal`), groups (`microsoft.graph.group`), or users (`microsoft.graph.user`) from deleted items. The OData cast type is a required part of the URI and calling `GET /directory/deleteditems` without a type is **not** supported.

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the query parameters that are supported by the resource that is specified by the OData cast. That is, `$count`, `$expand`, `$filter`, `$orderBy`, `$search`, `$select`, and `$top` query parameters. Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For example:

```msgraph-interactive
https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.group?&$count=true&$orderBy=deletedDateTime desc&$select=id,displayName,deletedDateTime
ConsistencyLevel: eventual
```

This example requires the **ConsistencyLevel** header because the `$orderBy` and `$count` query parameters are used in the query.

### Examples using the $orderBy OData query parameter

The `$orderBy` OData query parameter is supported on the **deletedDateTime**, **displayName**, and **userPrincipalName** properties of the deleted object types. On the **deletedDateTime** property, the query requires adding the [advanced query parameters](/graph/aad-advanced-queries) (**ConsistencyLevel** header set to `true` and `$count=true` query string).

| OData cast | Properties supporting $orderBy | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| microsoft.graph.user | deletedDateTime, displayName, userPrincipalName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.user?$orderBy=userPrincipalName |
| microsoft.graph.group | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.group?$orderBy=deletedDateTime asc&$count=true |
| microsoft.graph.application | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.application?$orderBy=displayName |
| microsoft.graph.device | deletedDateTime, displayName | /directory/deletedItems/microsoft.graph.device?$orderBy=deletedDateTime&$count=true |

## Request headers
| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer &lt;code&gt; *Required*|
| Accept  | application/json |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [directoryObject](../resources/directoryobject.md) objects in the response body.
