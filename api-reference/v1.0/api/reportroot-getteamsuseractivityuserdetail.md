## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "samples" } -->

```http
GET /reports/getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail(period='{period_value}')
GET /reports/getTeamsUserActivityUserDetail(date={date_value})
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide one of the following parameters with a valid value.

| Parameter | Type   | Description                              |
| :-------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| period    | string | Specifies the length of time over which the report is aggregated. The supported values for {period_value} are: D7, D30, D90, and D180. These values follow the format D*n* where *n* represents the number of days over which the report is aggregated. |
| date      | Date   | Specifies the date for which you would like to view the users who performed any activity. {date_value} must have a format of YYYY-MM-DD. As this report is only available for the past 30 days, {date_value} should be a date from that range. |

> **Note:** You need to set either period or date in the URL.

## Request headers

| Name          | Description               |

| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns:

- Report Refresh Date
- Tenant Display Name
- Shared Channel Tenant Display Names
- User Id
- User Principal Name
- Last Activity Date
- Is Deleted
- Deleted Date
- Assigned Products
- Team Chat Message Count
- Private Chat Message Count
- Call Count
- Meeting Count
- Post Messages
- Reply Messages
- Urgent Messages
- Meetings Organized Count
- Meetings Attended Count
- Ad Hoc Meetings Organized Count
- Ad Hoc Meetings Attended Count
- Scheduled One-time Meetings Organized Count
- Scheduled One-time Meetings Attended Count
- Scheduled Recurring Meetings Organized Count
- Scheduled Recurring Meetings Attended Count
- Audio Duration
- Video Duration
- Screen Share Duration
- Audio Duration In Seconds
- Video Duration In Seconds
- Screen Share Duration In Seconds
- Has Other Action
- Is Licensed
- Report Period

> [!NOTE] 
> The values in the Meetings Organized Count might not be the sum of the Ad Hoc Meetings Organized Count, Scheduled One-time Meetings Organized Count, and Scheduled Recurring Meetings Organized Count that a user organized during the specified time period. This is because the Unclassified meetings value is not included in the output CSV file. For details, see [Microsoft Teams user activity report](/microsoftteams/teams-analytics-and-reports/user-activity-report).
