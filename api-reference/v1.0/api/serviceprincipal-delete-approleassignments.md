# Delete appRoleAssignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Deletes an [appRoleAssignment](../resources/approleassignment.md) that a service principal has been granted.

App roles which are assigned to service principals are also known as [application permissions](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types). Deleting an app role assignment for a service principal is equivalent to revoking the app-only permission grant.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /servicePrincipals/{servicePrincipal-id}/appRoleAssignments/{appRoleAssignment-id}
DELETE /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/appRoleAssignments/{appRoleAssignment-id}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend you delete app role assignments using the [Delete appRoleAssignedTo](serviceprincipal-delete-approleassignedto.md) method which deletes through the **appRoleAssignedTo** relationship of the _resource_ service principal, instead of this method.

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response
