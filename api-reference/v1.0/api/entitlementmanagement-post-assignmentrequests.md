# Create accessPackageAssignmentRequest

Namespace: microsoft.graph


In [Microsoft Entra Entitlement Management](../resources/entitlementmanagement-overview.md), create a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.  This operation is used to assign a user to an access package, update the assignment, or to remove an access package assignment.

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

[!INCLUDE [permissions-table](../includes/permissions/entitlementmanagement-post-assignmentrequests-permissions.md)]

## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
``` http
POST /identityGovernance/entitlementManagement/assignmentRequests
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer \{token\}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object.

For an administrator to request to create an assignment for a user, the value of the **requestType** property is `adminAdd`, and the **assignment** property contains the `targetId` of the user being assigned, the **assignmentPolicyId** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md), and the **accessPackageId** property identifying the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md).

For an administrator to request to update an assignment (for example to extend the assignment or update answers to questions), the value of the **requestType** property is `adminUpdate`, and the **assignment** property contains the **id** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) being updated.

For an administrator to request to remove an assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `adminRemove`, and the **assignment** property contains the **id** property identifying the [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) being removed.

For a non-administrator user to request to create their own assignment for either a first assignment or renew assignment, the value of the **requestType** property is `userAdd`. The **assignment** property contains an object with the `targetId` with the `id` of the user. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

For a non-administrator user to request to update their own assignments, the value of the **requestType** property is `userUpdate`. The **assignment** property contains the `targetId` with the `id` of the users. The **assignmentPolicyId** property identifies the [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](../resources/accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md). The **accessPackageId** property identifies the [accessPackage](../resources/accesspackage.md). The user making the request must already exist in the directory.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a 200-series response code and a new [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](../resources/accesspackageassignmentrequest.md) object in the response body.

If this is an `adminAdd` request, then subsequently an [accessPackageAssignment](../resources/accesspackageassignment.md) and, if needed, an [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) are also created. You can locate those using the query parameters when [listing accessPackageAssignments](entitlementmanagement-list-assignments.md).

## Examples

### Example 1: Admin requests a direct assignment for a user already in the directory
#### Request

The following is an example of the request for a direct assignment, in which the administrator is requesting the creation of an assignment for the user. Because the [accessPackageSubject](../resources/accesspackagesubject.md) might not yet exist, the value of the **targetID** is the object ID of the user being assigned, the value of the **accessPackageId** is the desired access package for that user, and the value of **assignmentPolicyId** is a direct assignment policy in that access package.

### Example 2: Remove an assignment

To remove assignments, create a new accessPackageAssignmentRequest object with the following settings:

+ The value of the **requestType** property set to `adminRemove`.
+ In the assignment property, include an object with the identifier of the accessPackageAssignment object to delete.

#### Request

The following example shows how to remove an assignment.
