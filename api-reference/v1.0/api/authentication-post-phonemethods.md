# Create phoneMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add a new [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) for a user. A user may only have one phone of each type, captured in the **phoneType** property. This means, for example, adding a `mobile` phone to a user with a preexisting `mobile` phone will fail. Additionally, a user must always have a `mobile` phone before adding an `alternateMobile` phone.

Adding a phone number makes it available for use in both Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA) and self-service password reset (SSPR), if enabled.

Additionally, if a user is enabled by policy to use SMS sign-in and a `mobile` number is added, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.

## HTTP request

Add a phone authentication method to your own account. For a signed-in user to update their own authentication method, they must have satisfied a multi-factor authentication requirement during sign in.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /me/authentication/phoneMethods
```

Add a phone authentication method to another user's account.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/authentication/phoneMethods
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Description   |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object. The JSON must include `phoneNumber` and `phoneType`, but not `smsSignInState` (which is read-only).

| Property     | Type        | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
|phoneNumber|String|The phone number to text or call for authentication. Phone numbers use the format `+{country code} {number}x{extension}`, with extension optional. For example, `+1 5555551234` or `+1 5555551234x123` are valid. Numbers are rejected when creating or updating if they do not match the required format.|
|phoneType|String|Possible values are: `mobile`, `alternateMobile`, and `office`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a new [phoneAuthenticationMethod](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object in the response body.
