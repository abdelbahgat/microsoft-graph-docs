# Permanently delete item

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Currently, deleted items functionality is only supported for the [application](../resources/application.md), [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md), [group](../resources/group.md) and [user](../resources/user.md) resources. You can permanently delete an item from deleted items. But, once an item is permanently deleted, it **cannot** be restored.
