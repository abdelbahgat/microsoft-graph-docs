# List childFolders

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Get the folder collection under the specified folder. You can use the `.../me/mailFolders` shortcut to get the top-level 
folder collection and navigate to another folder.

By default, this operation does not return hidden folders. Use a query parameter _includeHiddenFolders_ to include them in the response.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.ReadBasic, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.ReadBasic.All, Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the child folders under the specified folder, excluding those that are hidden:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders
```

To include _hidden_ child folders in the response:
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders?includeHiddenFolders=true
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/childFolders?includeHiddenFolders=true
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.
