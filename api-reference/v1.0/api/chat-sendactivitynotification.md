### Example 4: Notify a user about an event in relation to a chat

As shown in the previous examples, you can link to different aspects of the chat. However, if you want to link to an aspect that is not part of the chat, or is not represented by Microsoft Graph, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. Also, `webUrl` is required when setting `topic` source to `text`.
