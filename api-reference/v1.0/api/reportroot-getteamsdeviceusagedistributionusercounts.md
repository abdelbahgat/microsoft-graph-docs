## Response

If successful, this method returns a `302 Found` response that redirects to a preauthenticated download URL for the report. That URL can be found in the `Location` header in the response.

Preauthenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header.

The CSV file has the following headers for columns:

- Report Refresh Date
- Web
- Windows Phone
- Android Phone
- iOS
- Mac
- Windows
- Chrome OS
- Linux
- Report Period

> [!CAUTION] 
> The **Windows Phone** column is deprecated and its value will always be `0`. It's kept in the response for backward compatibility reasons.
