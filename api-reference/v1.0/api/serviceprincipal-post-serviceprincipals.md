# Create servicePrincipal

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Create a new [servicePrincipal](../resources/serviceprincipal.md) object.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Adding [**passwordCredential**](../resources/passwordcredential.md) when creating servicePrincipals is not supported. Use the [addPassword](serviceprincipal-addpassword.md) method to add passwords or secrets for a servicePrincipal.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (work or school account) | Application.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Application.ReadWrite.OwnedBy, Application.ReadWrite.All |

For multi-tenant apps, the calling user must also be in one of the following [Azure AD roles](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference):

+ Global Administrator
+ Application Administrator
+ Cloud Application Administrator roles

For single-tenant apps where the calling user is a non-admin user but is the owner of the backing application, the user must have the *Application Developer* role.
