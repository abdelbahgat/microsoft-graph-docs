# List teamsApp

Namespace: microsoft.graph

List [apps](../resources/teamsapp.md) from the Microsoft Teams app catalog.
This includes apps from the Microsoft Teams store, as well as apps from your organization's app catalog (the tenant app catalog). To get apps from your organization's app catalog only, specify `organization` as the **distributionMethod** in the request.

> [!NOTE]
> The `id` of a **teamsApp** resource is generated by the server and is not the same as the `id` specified in a Teams app manifest. The `id` provided by the developer as part of the Teams app manifest is stamped as the `externalId` in the **teamsApp** resource.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Permission Type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:---------------------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | AppCatalog.Submit, AppCatalog.Read.All, AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All, Directory.Read.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
| Application                            | AppCatalog.Read.All, AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All |

> **Note**: Permissions marked with ** are supported only for backward compatibility. We recommend that you update your solutions to use an alternative permission listed in the previous table and avoid using these permissions going forward.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /appCatalogs/teamsApps
```

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$filter`, `$select`, and `$expand` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response.

Using `$expand=AppDefinitions` will return more information about the state of the app, such as the **publishingState**, which reflects the app submission review status and returns whether an app has been approved, rejected, or remains under review. 

> **Note:** You can filter on any of the fields of the [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object to shorten the list of results. You can use any of the following filter operations: Equal, not-equal, and, or, and not.

## Request headers

| Header        | Value                     |
|:--------------|:--------------------------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a list of [teamsApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) objects in the response body.
