# Update phoneAuthenticationMethod

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update a user's phone number associated with a [phone authentication method](../resources/phoneauthenticationmethod.md) object.

You can't change a phone's type. To change a phone's type, add a new number of the desired type and then delete the object with the original type.

If a user is enabled by policy to use SMS to sign in and the `mobile` number is changed, the system will attempt to register the number for use in that system.
