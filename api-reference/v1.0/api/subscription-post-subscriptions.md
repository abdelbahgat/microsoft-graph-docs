# Create subscription

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Subscribes a listener application to receive change notifications when the requested type of changes occur to the specified resource in Microsoft Graph.

See the table in the [Permissions](#permissions) section for the list of resources that support subscribing to change notifications. 

Some resources support the option to include encrypted resource data in change notifications. These resources include [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md), [contact](../resources/contact.md), [event](../resources/event.md), [message](../resources/message.md), and [presence](../resources/presence.md). For more information, see [Set up change notifications that include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data) and [Change notifications for Outlook resources in Microsoft Graph](/graph/outlook-change-notifications-overview).

## Permissions

Creating a subscription requires read scope to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the `Mail.Read` permission. 
 
Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including [taking caution](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#best-practices-for-requesting-permissions) before choosing the permissions, search for the following permissions in [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

We recommend that you use the permissions as documented in the previous table. Due to security restrictions, Microsoft Graph subscriptions will not support write access permissions when only read access permissions are needed.

> **Note**: Permissions marked with * use [resource-specific consent](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent).

[!INCLUDE [teams-subscription-notes](../../includes/teams-subscription-notes.md)]

### driveItem

Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.

On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.

OneDrive for Business and SharePoint support sending your application notifications of security events that occur on a **driveItem**. To subscribe to these events, add the `prefer:includesecuritywebhooks` header to your request to create a subscription. After the subscription is created, you will receive notifications when the permissions on an item change. This header is applicable to SharePoint and OneDrive for Business but not consumer OneDrive accounts.

### contact, event, and message

You can subscribe to changes in Outlook **contact**, **event**, or **message** resources.

[!INCLUDE [outlook-subscription-notes](../../includes/outlook-subscription-notes.md)]

### presence

Subscriptions on **presence** require any resource data included in a change notification to be encrypted. Always specify the **encryptionCertificate** parameter when [creating a subscription](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data#creating-a-subscription) to avoid failure. See more information about [setting up change notifications to include resource data](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data).

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object.
The `clientState` and `latestSupportedTlsVersion` fields are optional.

#### Resources examples

The following are valid values for the resource property of the subscription:

| Resource type | Examples |
|:------ |:----- |
|[Call records](../resources/callrecords-callrecord.md)|`communications/callRecords`|
|[Chat message](../resources/chatmessage.md) | `chats/{id}/messages`, `chats/getAllMessages`, `teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages`, `teams/getAllMessages` |
|[Contacts](../resources/contact.md)|`me/contacts`|
|[Conversations](../resources/conversation.md)|`groups('{id}')/conversations`|
|[Drives](../resources/driveitem.md)|`me/drive/root`|
|[Events](../resources/event.md)|`me/events`|
|[Groups](../resources/group.md)|`groups`|
|[List](../resources/list.md)|`sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}`|
|[Mail](../resources/message.md)|`me/mailfolders('inbox')/messages`, `me/messages`|
|[Presence](../resources/presence.md)| `/communications/presences/{id}` (single user), `/communications/presences?$filter=id in ('{id}','{id}',…)` (multiple users)|
|[printer](../resources/printer.md) |`print/printers/{id}/jobs`|
|[PrintTaskDefinition](../resources/printtaskdefinition.md)|`print/taskDefinitions/{id}/tasks`|
|[Security alert](../resources/alert.md)|`security/alerts?$filter=status eq 'New'`|

|[Users](../resources/user.md)|`users`|

> **Note:** Any path starting with `me` can also be used with `users/{id}` instead of `me` to target a specific user instead of the current user.

### Response

The following is an example of the response.

}
```

#### Notification endpoint validation

The subscription notification endpoint (specified in the `notificationUrl` property) must be capable of responding to a validation request as described in [Set up notifications for changes in user data](/graph/webhooks#notification-endpoint-validation). If validation fails, the request to create the subscription returns a 400 Bad Request error.
