### Example 2: Notify a user about a channel tab

Similar to the previous example, this example uses `entityUrl` for the `topic`. However, this example links to a [tab](../resources/teamstab.md) in a [channel](../resources/channel.md). The tab hosts a page showing the user the status of their hotel reservation. Selecting the notification will take the user to the tab, where they can check their reservation.

### Example 3: Notify a user about a channel tab using user principal name

Similar to the previous example, this example uses `entityUrl` for the `topic`. However, this example links to a [tab](../resources/teamstab.md) in a [channel](../resources/channel.md). The tab hosts a page showing the user the status of their hotel reservation. Selecting the notification will take the user to the tab, where they can check their reservation.

### Example 4: Notify a user about an event using custom topic

As seen in the previous examples, you can link to different aspects of the team. However, if you want to link to an aspect that is not part of the team or is not represented by Microsoft Graph, or you want to customize the name, you can set the source of the `topic` to `text` and pass in a custom value for it. `webUrl` is required when setting `topic` source to `text`.

### Example 5: Notify the team members about pending finance approval requests

The following example shows how you can send an activity feed notification to all team members. This example is similar to previous examples. However, in this case, the **recipient** is a [teamMembersNotificationRecipient](../resources/teammembersnotificationrecipient.md). Note that the **teamId** specified in the **recipient** must match the **teamId** specified in the request URL.

> **Note:** The ability to send notifications to all team members is limited to teams with 10,000 members or less. If the team exceeds 10,000 members, none of the team members will receive a notification.
