# Create permissionGrantConditionSet in includes collection of permissionGrantPolicy

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Add conditions under which a permission grant event is *included* in a permission grant policy. You do this by adding a [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) to the **includes** collection of a  [permissionGrantPolicy](../resources/permissionGrantPolicy.md).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Policy.ReadWrite.PermissionGrant |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Policy.ReadWrite.PermissionGrant |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /policies/permissionGrantPolicies/{id}/includes
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-type | application/json. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and an [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) object in the response body.

## Examples

### Request

In this example, *all* delegated permissions for client apps from verified publishers are included in the permission grant policy. Because all the other conditions from the [permissionGrantConditionSet](../resources/permissiongrantconditionset.md) were omitted, they will take their default values, which in each case is the most-inclusive.
