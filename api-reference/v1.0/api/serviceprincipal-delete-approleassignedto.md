## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

You can address the service principal using either its **id** or **appId**. **id** and **appId** are referred to as the **Object ID** and **Application (Client) ID**, respectively, in the Azure portal

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /servicePrincipals/{id}/appRoleAssignedTo/{appRoleAssignment-id}
DELETE /servicePrincipals(appId='{appId}')/appRoleAssignedTo/{appRoleAssignment-id}
```

> [!NOTE]
> As a best practice, we recommend you use this method to delete app role assignments, instead of the [Delete appRoleAssignments ](serviceprincipal-delete-approleassignments.md) method which deletes through the **appRoleAssignments** relationship of the assigned user, group, or service principal.

|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

Do not supply a request body for this method.
