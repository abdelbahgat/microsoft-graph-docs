## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /devices/{id}/registeredUsers
```
## Optional query parameters
This method supports the `$search`, `$count`, and `$filter` [OData query parameters](/graph/query-parameters) to help customize the response. OData cast is also enabled, for example, you can cast to get just the directoryRoles the device is a member of. You can use `$search` on the **displayName** property.

Some queries are supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries).

When items are added or updated for this resource, they are specially indexed for use with the `$count` and `$search` query parameters. There can be a slight delay between when an item is added or updated and when it is available in the index.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
