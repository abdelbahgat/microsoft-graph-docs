## HTTP request

<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->

``` http
GET /communications/callRecords/getPstnCalls
```

## Function parameters

In the request URL, provide the following query parameters with values.
The following table shows the parameters that can be used with this function.

|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|fromDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Start of time range to query. UTC, inclusive.<br/>Time range is based on the call start time.|
|toDateTime|DateTimeOffset|End of time range to query. UTC, inclusive.|

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **fromDateTime** and **toDateTime** values cannot be more than a date range of 90 days.

## Request headers

## Response

If successful, this function returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [pstnCallLogRow](../resources/callrecords-pstncalllogrow.md) entries in the response body.
  
If there are more than 1000 entries in the date range, the body also includes an `@odata.NextLink` with a URL to query the next page of call entries. The last page in the date range does not have `@odata.NextLink`. For more information, see [paging Microsoft Graph data in your app](/graph/paging).

## Example

The following example shows getting a collection of records for PSTN calls that occurred in the specified date range. The response includes `"@odata.count": 1000` to enumerate the number of records in this first response, and `@odata.NextLink` to get records beyond the first 1000. For readability, the response shows only a collection of 1 record. Please assume there are more than 1000 calls in that date range.
