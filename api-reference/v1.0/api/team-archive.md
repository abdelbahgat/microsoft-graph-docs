# Archive team

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Archive the specified [team](../resources/team.md). 
When a team is archived, users can no longer send or like messages on any channel in the team, edit the team's name, description, or other settings, or in general make most changes to the team.
Membership changes to the team continue to be allowed.

Archiving is an async operation. A team is archived once the async operation completes successfully, which may occur subsequent to a response from this API.

To archive a team, the team and [group](../resources/group.md) must have an owner.

To restore a team from its archived state, use the API to [unarchive](team-unarchive.md).

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | TeamSettings.ReadWrite.Group*, TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All**, Directory.ReadWrite.All** |

[!INCLUDE [teamwork-permissions-note](../../../includes/teamwork-permissions-note.md)]

> **Note**: This API supports admin permissions. Global admins and Microsoft Teams service admins can access teams that they are not a member of.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /teams/{id}/archive
```
## Request headers
| Header       | Value |
|:---------------|:--------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required.  |

## Request body
In the request, you may _optionally_ include the `shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers` parameter in a JSON body, as follows.
```JSON
{
    "shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers": true
}
```
This optional parameter defines whether to set permissions for team members to read-only on the SharePoint Online site associated with the team. Setting it to false or omitting the body altogether will result in this step being skipped.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The `shouldSetSpoSiteReadOnlyForMembers` parameter is not supported in the application context.

## Response

If archiving is started successfully, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response will also contain a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md) that was created to handle archiving of the team. Check the status of the archiving operation by making a GET request to this location.
