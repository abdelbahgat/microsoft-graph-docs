# entitlementManagementSchedule complex type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The entitlement management schedule is used in three scenarios in [Azure AD entitlement management](entitlementmanagement-overview.md). First, when an access package assignment request is created by a user who wants to obtain an access package assignment, this request can include a schedule for when the user would like to have an assignment. Second, an access package assignment that results from such a request also has a schedule.  Third, the `entitlementManagementSchedule` is also used in the [accessPackageAssignmentReviewSettings](accesspackageassignmentreviewsettings.md) of an assignment policy, to specify when the first access review will start and how often access reviews should reoccur.

## Properties
