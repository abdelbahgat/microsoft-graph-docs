# administrativeUnit resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

An administrative unit provides a conceptual container for user, group, and device directory objects. Using administrative units, a company administrator can now delegate administrative responsibilities to manage the users, groups, and devices contained within or scoped to an administrative unit to a regional or departmental administrator. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

Let's look at an example. Imagine that Contoso Corp is made up of two divisions - a West Coast Division and an East Coast Division. Directory roles at Contoso are scoped to the entire tenant. Lee, a Contoso company administrator, wants to delegate administrative responsibilities, but scope them to the West Coast Division or the East Coast division.  Lee can create a *West Coast administrative unit* and place all West Coast users into this administrative unit.  Similarly, Lee can create an *East Coast administrative unit*.  Now Lee, can start delegating administrative responsibilities to others, but **scoped** to the new administrative units they created. Lee places Jennifer in a *helpdesk administrator* role **scoped** to the *West Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Jennifer to reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *West Coast administrative unit*.  Similarly, Lee places Dave in a *user account administrator* role **scoped** to the *East Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Dave to update users, assign licenses and reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *East Coast administrative unit*. For a video overview, please see [Introduction to Microsoft Entra Administrative Units](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Windows-Azure-Active-Directory/Introduction-to-Azure-Active-Directory-Administrative-Units).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#administrative-unit-properties).

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|An optional description for the administrative unit. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `in`, `startsWith`), `$search`.|
|displayName|String|Display name for the administrative unit. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderby`.|
|id|String|Unique identifier for the administrative unit. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`).|
|visibility|String|Controls whether the administrative unit and its members are hidden or public. Can be set to `HiddenMembership`. If not set (value is `null`), the default behavior is public. When set to `HiddenMembership`, only members of the administrative unit can list other members of the administrative unit.|

> [!TIP]
> Directory extensions and associated data are returned by default while schema extensions and associated data returned only on `$select`.

## Relationships
| Relationship | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|members|[directoryObject](directoryobject.md) collection|Users and groups that are members of this administrative unit. Supports `$expand`.|
|extensions|[extension](extension.md) collection|The collection of open extensions defined for this administrative unit. Nullable.|
|scopedRoleMembers|[scopedRoleMembership](scopedrolemembership.md) collection| Scoped-role members of this administrative unit. |
