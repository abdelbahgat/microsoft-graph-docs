# Use the Microsoft Graph Security API

The Microsoft Graph Security API provides a unified interface and schema to integrate with security solutions from Microsoft and ecosystem partners. This empowers customers to streamline security operations and better defend against increasing cyber threats. The Microsoft Graph Security API federates queries to all onboarded security providers and aggregates responses. Use the Microsoft Graph Security API to build applications that:

- Consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources
- Unlock contextual data to inform investigations
- Automate security tasks, business processes, workflows, and reporting
- Send threat indicators to Microsoft products for customized detections
- Invoke actions to in response to new threats
- Provide visibility into security data to enable proactive risk management

The Microsoft Graph Security API includes the following key entities.

## Alerts

Alerts are potential security issues within a customer's tenant that Microsoft or partner security solutions have identified and flagged for action or notification. With the Microsoft Graph Security [alerts](alert.md) entity, you can unify and streamline management of security issues across all integrated solutions. This also enables applications to correlate alerts and context to improve threat protection and response. With the alert update capability, you can sync the status of specific alerts across different security products and services that are integrated with the Microsoft Graph Security API by updating your [alerts](alert.md) entity.

Alerts from the following providers are available via the Microsoft Graph Security API. Support for GET alerts, PATCH alerts, and Subscribe (via webhooks) is indicated in the following table.

| Security provider | <p align="center">GET alert</p>| <p align="center">PATCH alert</p>| <p align="center">Subscribe to alert</p>|

> **Note:** New providers are continuously onboarding to the Microsoft Graph Security ecosystem. To request new providers or for extended support from existing providers, [file an issue in the Microsoft Graph Security GitHub repo](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/security-api-solutions/issues/new).

\* File issue: Alert status gets updated across Microsoft Graph Security API integrated applications but not reflected in the providerâ€™s management experience.

\*\* Microsoft Defender for Endpoint requires additional [user roles](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/user-roles) to those required by the Microsoft Graph Security API. Only the users in both Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft Graph Security API roles can have access to the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data. Because application-only authentication is not limited by this, we recommend that you use an application-only authentication token.

\*\*\* Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts are available via the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps integration. This means you will get Microsoft Defender for Identity alerts only if you have joined Unified SecOps and connected Microsoft Defender for Identity into Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Learn more about [how to integrate Microsoft Defender for Identity and Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/defender-for-identity/mcas-integration).

## eDiscovery

[Microsoft Purview eDiscovery (Premium)](/microsoft-365/compliance/overview-ediscovery-20) provides an end-to-end workflow to preserve, collect, analyze, review, and export content that's responsive to your organization's internal and external investigations.

## Information protection

The Microsoft Graph threat assessment API helps organizations to assess the threat received by any user in a tenant. This empowers customers to report spam emails, phishing URLs or malware attachments they receive to Microsoft. The policy check result and rescan result can help tenant administrators understand the threat scanning verdict and adjust their organizational policy.

## Secure Score

[Microsoft Secure Score](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/A-new-home-and-an-all-new-look-for-Microsoft-Secure-Score/ba-p/529641) is a security analytics solution that gives you visibility into your security portfolio and how to improve it. With a single score, you can better understand what you have done to reduce your risk in Microsoft solutions. You can also compare your score with other organizations and see how your score has been trending over time. The Microsoft Graph Security [secureScore](securescore.md) and [secureScoreControlProfile](securescorecontrolprofile.md) entities help you balance your organization's security and productivity needs while enabling the appropriate mix of security features. You can also project what your score would be after you adopt security features.
