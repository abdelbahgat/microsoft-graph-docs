# Enroll corporate-owned devices by using Intune

Namespace: microsoft.graph

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** The Microsoft Graph API for Intune requires an [active Intune license](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) for the tenant.

You can enroll organization-owned or corporate-owned devices to manage with Intune in a variety of ways, depending on the type of device, how the device was purchased, and the needs of the organization. You also can install the Company Portal app to enroll and manage corporate-owned devices, like in a "bring your own device" (BYOD) scenario.

The following Graph resources are available to manage corporate-owned devices in Intune:

- [Device management](intune-enrollment-devicemanagement.md)
- [Enrollment state](intune-enrollment-enrollmentstate.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentity.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity import status](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentityimportstatus.md)
- [Imported windows autopilot device identity state](intune-enrollment-importedwindowsautopilotdeviceidentitystate.md)
