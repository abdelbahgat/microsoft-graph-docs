# extensionProperty resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a directory extension that can be used to add a custom property to directory objects without requiring an external data store. For example, if an organization has a line of business (LOB) application that requires a Skype ID for each user in the directory, Microsoft Graph can be used to register a new property named **skypeId** on the directoryâ€™s User object, and then write a value to the new property for a specific user.

Directory extensions can be added to following directory objects:
+ [user](user.md)
+ [group](group.md)
+ [organization](organization.md)
+ [device](device.md)
+ [application](application.md) resources

Only 100 extension values, across *all* types and *all* applications, can be written to any single Azure AD resource.

Use this resource and associated methods to manage the directory extension definitions. To manage the directory extension data on the extended resource instance, use the same REST request that you use to manage the resource instance.

For more information about Microsoft Graph extensibility, see [Add custom properties to resources using extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).

Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Extensions created through Azure AD Graph (deprecated) and custom data synchronized from on-premises Active Directory using Azure AD Connect Sync are represented as directory extensions in Microsoft Graph.

## Methods

| Method       | Return Type | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|:------------|
| [Create extensionProperties](../api/application-post-extensionproperty.md) | [extensionProperty](extensionProperty.md) | Create an extension property on an application object. |
| [List extensionProperties](../api/application-list-extensionproperty.md) | [extensionProperty](extensionProperty.md) collection | List extension properties on an application object. |
| [Get extensionProperty](../api/extensionproperty-get.md) | [extensionProperty](extensionProperty.md) collection | List extension properties on an application object. |
| [Delete extensionProperty](../api/extensionproperty-delete.md) | None | Delete an extension property from an application object. You can delete only properties that aren't synced from on-premises active directory. |

> [!TIP]
> 1. To set a value for the extension property to an instance of a resource that is specified in **targetObjects**, use the Update operation of the resource. For example, the [Update user](../api/user-update.md) API to set the value for a user.
> 2. To remove the extension property and its value from an instance of a resource that is specified in **targetObjects**, set the value of the extension property to `null`.
