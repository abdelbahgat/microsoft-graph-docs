# Azure AD authentication methods policies API overview

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Authentication methods policies define [authentication methods](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-methods) and the users that are allowed to use them to sign in and perform multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Authentication methods policies that can be managed in Microsoft Graph include FIDO2 Security Keys and Passwordless Phone Sign-in with Microsoft Authenticator app.

The authentication method policies APIs are used to manage policy settings. For example:

* Define the types of FIDO2 security keys that can be used in the Azure AD tenant.
* Define the users or groups of users who are allowed to use FIDO2 Security Keys or Passwordless Phone Sign-in to sign in to Azure AD.
* Define the users or groups of users who should be reminded to set up the Microsoft Authenticator for MFA using push notifications.
