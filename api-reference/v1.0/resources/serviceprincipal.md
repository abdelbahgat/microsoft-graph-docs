# servicePrincipal resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an instance of an application in a directory. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/serviceprincipal-delta.md) function. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in.

## Properties

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Specific usage of `$filter` and the `$search` query parameter is supported only when you use the **ConsistencyLevel** header set to `eventual` and `$count`. For more information, see [Advanced query capabilities on Azure AD directory objects](/graph/aad-advanced-queries#service-principal-properties).

| Property     | Type |Description|

| addIns | [addIn](addin.md) collection | Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts. For example, applications that can render file streams [may set the addIns property](/onedrive/developer/file-handlers/?view=odsp-graph-online&preserve-view=true) for its "FileHandler" functionality. This will let services like Microsoft 365 call the application in the context of a document the user is working on.|
|alternativeNames|String collection| Used to retrieve service principals by subscription, identify resource group and full resource ids for [managed identities](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`).|

|loginUrl|String|Specifies the URL where the service provider redirects the user to Azure AD to authenticate. Azure AD uses the URL to launch the application from Microsoft 365 or the Azure AD My Apps. When blank, Azure AD performs IdP-initiated sign-on for applications configured with [SAML-based single sign-on](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on#saml-sso). The user launches the application from Microsoft 365, the Azure AD My Apps, or the Azure AD SSO URL.|
|logoutUrl|String| Specifies the URL that will be used by Microsoft's authorization service to logout an user using OpenId Connect [front-channel](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-frontchannel-1_0.html), [back-channel](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-backchannel-1_0.html) or SAML logout protocols.|

|oauth2PermissionScopes|[permissionScope](permissionScope.md) collection|The delegated permissions exposed by the application. For more information see the **oauth2PermissionScopes** property on the [application](application.md) entity's **api** property. Not nullable.|
| passwordCredentials | [passwordCredential](passwordcredential.md) collection|The collection of password credentials associated with the application. Not nullable.|
|preferredSingleSignOnMode|string|Specifies the single sign-on mode configured for this application. Azure AD uses the preferred single sign-on mode to launch the application from Microsoft 365 or the Azure AD My Apps. The supported values are `password`, `saml`, `notSupported`, and `oidc`.|
|preferredTokenSigningKeyThumbprint|String|This property can be used on SAML applications (apps that have preferredSingleSignOnMode set to `saml`) to control which certificate is used to sign the SAML responses. For applications that are not SAML, do not write or otherwise rely on this property.|
|replyUrls|String collection|The URLs that user tokens are sent to for sign in with the associated application, or the redirect URIs that OAuth 2.0 authorization codes and access tokens are sent to for the associated application. Not nullable. |
|resourceSpecificApplicationPermissions|[resourceSpecificPermission](../resources/resourcespecificpermission.md) collection|The resource-specific application permissions exposed by this application. Currently, resource-specific permissions are only supported for [Teams apps accessing to specific chats and teams](/microsoftteams/platform/graph-api/rsc/resource-specific-consent) using Microsoft Graph.

For example,<ul><li>Client apps can specify a resource URI which is based on the values of this property to acquire an access token, which is the URI returned in the "aud" claim.</li></ul><br>The any operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties. Not nullable. <br><br> Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`).|
|servicePrincipalType|String|Identifies whether the service principal represents an application, a managed identity, or a legacy application. This is set by Azure AD internally. The **servicePrincipalType** property can be set to three different values: <ul><li>__Application__ - A service principal that represents an application or service. The **appId** property identifies the associated app registration, and matches the **appId** of an [application](application.md), possibly from a different tenant. If the associated app registration is missing, tokens are not issued for the service principal.</li><li>__ManagedIdentity__ - A service principal that represents a [managed identity](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Service principals representing managed identities can be granted access and permissions, but cannot be updated or modified directly.</li><li>__Legacy__ - A service principal that represents an app created before app registrations, or through legacy experiences. Legacy service principal can have credentials, service principal names, reply URLs, and other properties which are editable by an authorized user, but does not have an associated app registration. The **appId** value does not associate the service principal with an app registration. The service principal can only be used in the tenant where it was created.</li><li>__SocialIdp__ - For internal use. </ul>|
| signInAudience | String | Specifies the Microsoft accounts that are supported for the current application. Read-only. <br><br>Supported values are:<ul><li>`AzureADMyOrg`: Users with a Microsoft work or school account in my organization's Azure AD tenant (single-tenant).</li><li>`AzureADMultipleOrgs`: Users with a Microsoft work or school account in any organization's Azure AD tenant (multi-tenant).</li><li>`AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount`: Users with a personal Microsoft account, or a work or school account in any organization's Azure AD tenant.</li><li>`PersonalMicrosoftAccount`: Users with a personal Microsoft account only.</li></ul> |

The value is the union of strings set here and on the associated [application](application.md) entity's **tags** property.<br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`). |
| tokenEncryptionKeyId |String|Specifies the keyId of a public key from the keyCredentials collection. When configured, Azure AD issues tokens for this application encrypted using the key specified by this property. The application code that receives the encrypted token must use the matching private key to decrypt the token before it can be used for the signed-in user.|
| verifiedPublisher          | [verifiedPublisher](verifiedPublisher.md)                            | Specifies the verified publisher of the application which this service principal represents.
