# externalSponsors complex type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Used in the approval stage of an access package assignment policy.
It's a subtype of [subjectSet](subjectset.md), in which the `@odata.type` value `#microsoft.graph.externalSponsors` indicates that a requesting user's connected organization external sponsors are to be the approver. This approver is only applicable to requests from users who are part of a connected organization.  When creating an access package assignment policy approval stage with externalSponsors, also include another approver, such as a single user or group member, in case the connected organization doesn't have an external sponsor.
