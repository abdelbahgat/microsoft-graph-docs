# accessReviewReviewerScope resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The accessReviewReviewerScope defines who will review instances of an [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md). It is an OData query that allows reviewers to be specified both as a static list of users (that is, specific users, group owners, and group members) or dynamically in which every user is reviewed by their manager or by group owners. To create a self-review (where users review their own access), do not provide reviewers on [accessReviewScheduleDefinition](accessreviewscheduledefinition.md) creation.

Inherits from [accessReviewScope](../resources/accessreviewscope.md).

## Properties
| Property | Type | Description |
| :-------------------------| :---------- | :---------- |
| query | String | The query specifying who will be the reviewer. See table for examples. |
| queryType | String | The type of query. Examples include `MicrosoftGraph` and `ARM`. |
| queryRoot | String | In the scenario where reviewers need to be specified dynamically, this property is used to indicate the relative source of the query. This property is only required if a relative query, for example, `./manager`, is specified. Possible value: `decisions`. |

For more about configuration options for **reviewers**, see [Assign reviewers to your access review definition using the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/accessreviews-reviewers-concept).
