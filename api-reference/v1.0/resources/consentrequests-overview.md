# Azure Active Directory consent requests

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) consent requests help you manage the request workflow for users attempting to access apps that require admin approval.

To allow users to request access or admin consent for applications they're unauthorized to grant consent to themselves, first enable the consent request workflow. 

>[!NOTE]
>The current APIs are limited to configuring the workflow and reading the list of requests. At this time, there arenâ€™t any methods available to programmatically approve or deny a request. However, the contents of the request can be used to recreate a URL which can be used to grant admin consent and approve a request.

[!INCLUDE [GDPR-related-guidance](../../includes/gdpr-msgraph-export-note.md)]

The consent request resource types include:

* [adminConsentRequestPolicy](../resources/adminconsentrequestpolicy.md): Specifies the policy by which app consent requests can be created and managed for the entire tenant. There is a single **adminConsentRequestPolicy** per tenant.
* [appConsentRequest](../resources/appconsentrequest.md): A request that represents a collection of **userConsentRequest** objects for a specific application.
* [userConsentRequest](../resources/userconsentrequest.md): A request created by a user to use an app that requires admin consent to access.
* [appConsentRequestScope](../resources/appconsentrequestscope.md): A resource that contains details of the dynamic permission scopes being requested for an application.
