# user resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user account. This resource is an open type that allows other properties to be passed in. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties as [extensions](/graph/extensibility-overview).
- Subscribing to [change notifications](/graph/webhooks).
- Using [delta query](/graph/delta-query-overview) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user-delta.md) function.

### mail and proxyAddresses properties
**mail** and **proxyAddresses** are both email-related properties. **proxyAddresses** is a collection of addresses only relevant for Microsoft Exchange server. It's used to store a list of mail addresses for a user that are tied to a single mailbox. **mail** property is used as the user's email address for various purposes including user sign in and defines the primary proxy address.
 
Both **mail** and **proxyAddresses** can be retrieved through the [GET user](/graph/api/user-get) API on MS Graph. **mail** can be updated via the [PATCH method of the Update user](/graph/api/user-update) API, but **proxyAddresses** can't be updated via Microsoft Graph. When a user's **mail** property is updated, it triggers recalculation of **proxyAddresses** and the newly updated mail is set to be the primary proxy address, except in the following scenarios: 
 
1. If a user has a license that includes Microsoft Exchange, all their proxy addresses must belong to a verified domain on the tenant. Any that don't belong to verified domains are silently removed.
2. A user's mail will NOT be set to the primary proxy address if the user is a guest and the primary proxy address contains the guest user UPN string with #EXT#.
3. A user's mail will NOT be removed, even if they no longer have proxy addresses, if the user is a guest.
 
**proxyAddresses** are unique across directory objects (users, groups, and organizational contacts). If a user's **mail** property conflicts with one of the **proxyAddresses** of another object, you'll successfully update the **mail** property; however, the new mail value won't be added to the **proxyAddresses** collection.

### Legal age group property definitions

This section explains how the three age group properties (**legalAgeGroupClassification**, **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor**) are used by Azure AD administrators and enterprise application developers to meet age-related regulations:
- The **legalAgeGroupClassification** property is read-only. It is used by enterprise application developers to ensure the correct handling of a user based on their legal age group. It is calculated based on the user's **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor** properties.
- **ageGroup** and **consentProvidedForMinor** are optional properties used by Azure AD administrators to help ensure the use of an account is handled correctly based on the age-related regulatory rules governing the user's country or region.

For example: Cameron is administrator of a directory for an elementary school in Holyport in the United Kingdom. At the beginning of the school year he uses the admissions paperwork to obtain consent from the minor's parents based on the age-related regulations of the United Kingdom. The consent obtained from the parent allows the minor's account to be used by Holyport school and Microsoft apps. Cameron then creates all the accounts and sets **ageGroup** to `minor` and **consentProvidedForMinor** to `granted`. Applications used by his students are then able to suppress features that are not suitable for minors.

<!-- Note that the following 3 sub-sections are only documented like enums for a consistent user experience but they are String types.-->

#### legalAgeGroupClassification values

| Member    | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|null|Default value, no **ageGroup** has been set for the user.|
|MinorWithoutParentalConsent |(Reserved for future use)|
|MinorWithParentalConsent| The user is considered a minor based on the age-related regulations of their country or region and the administrator of the account has obtained appropriate consent from a parent or guardian.|
|Adult|The user considered an adult based on the age-related regulations of their country or region.|
|NotAdult|The user is from a country or region that has additional age-related regulations (such as the United States, United Kingdom, European Union or South Korea), and the user's age is between a minor and an adult age (as stipulated based on country or region). Generally, this means that teenagers are considered as `notAdult` in regulated countries.|
|MinorNoParentalConsentRequired|The user is a minor but is from a country or region that has no age-related regulations.|

#### ageGroup values

| Member    | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|
|null|Default value, no **ageGroup** has been set for the user.|
|Minor|The user is considered a minor.|
|NotAdult|The user is from a country that has statutory regulations (such as the United States, United Kingdom, European Union or South Korea) and user's age is more than the upper limit of kid age (as per country) and less than lower limit of adult age (as stipulated based on country or region). So basically, teenagers are considered as `notAdult` in regulated countries.|
|Adult|The user should be a treated as an adult.|

#### consentProvidedForMinor values

| Member    | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
|null|Default value, no **consentProvidedForMinor** has been set for the user.|
|Granted|Consent has been obtained for the user to have an account.|
|Denied|Consent has not been obtained for the user to have an account.|
|NotRequired|The user is from a location that does not require consent.|
