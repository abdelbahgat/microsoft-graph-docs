# calendarPermission resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

The permissions of a user with whom the calendar has been shared or delegated in an Outlook client.

List, create, get, update, and delete of calendar permissions is supported on behalf of only the calendar owner.

Getting the calendar permissions of a calendar on behalf of a sharee or delegate returns an empty calendar permissions collection.

Once a sharee or delegate has been set up for a calendar, you can [update](../api/calendarpermission-update.md) only the **role** property to change the permissions of a sharee or delegate. You cannot **update** the **allowedRoles**, **emailAddress**, **isInsideOrganization**, or **isRemovable** property. To change these properties, you should [delete](../api/calendarpermission-delete.md) the corresponding **calendarPermission** object and create another sharee or delegate in an Outlook client.
