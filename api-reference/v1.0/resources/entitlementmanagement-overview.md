# Working with the Microsoft Entra entitlement management API

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Microsoft Entra entitlement management can help you manage access to groups, applications, and SharePoint Online sites for internal users as well as users outside your organization.

By creating access packages with the roles users need to have across those resources, and defining policies for who can request an access package and how long they can have an assignment to an access package, you can govern the lifecycle of access for both internal and external users.

The entitlement management resource types include:

- [accessPackage](accesspackage.md): Defines the collections of resource roles and the policies for how one or more users may obtain access to those resources.
- [accessPackageAssignmentPolicy](accesspackageassignmentpolicy.md): Specifies the policy by which subjects may request or be assigned an access package via an access package assignment.
- [accessPackageAssignmentRequest](accesspackageassignmentrequest.md): Created by a user who wishes to obtain an access package assignment.
- [accessPackageAssignment](accesspackageassignment.md): An assignment of an access package to a particular subject, for a period of time.
- [accessPackageCatalog](accesspackagecatalog.md): A container for access packages.
- [accessPackageResource](accesspackageresource.md): A reference to a resource associated with an access package catalog.
- [accessPackageResourceRequest](accesspackageresourcerequest.md): A request to add a resource to an access package catalog.
- [accessPackageResourceEnvironment](accesspackageresourceenvironment.md): A reference to the geolocation of the resource. Applicable to Multi-Geo SharePoint Online sites.
- [connectedOrganization](connectedorganization.md): A connected organization for external users who can request access.
- [entitlementManagementSettings](entitlementmanagementsettings.md): Tenant-wide settings for Microsoft Entra entitlement management.
- [approval](approval.md): represents the decisions associated with an access package request.

In addition, you can manage role assignments for users, groups of users, and service principals to entitlement management-specific roles through entitlement management [role definitions](unifiedroledefinition.md).

The tenant where entitlement management is being used must have sufficient purchased or trial licenses. For more information about license requirements for the entitlement management feature, see [Entitlement management license requirements](/azure/active-directory/governance/entitlement-management-overview#license-requirements).
