# educationUser resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A user in the system. This is an education-specific variant of the user with the same **id** that Microsoft Graph will return from the non-education-specific `/users` endpoint. This object provides a targeted subset of properties from the core [user](../resources/user.md) object and adds a set of education-specific properties such as **primaryRole**, **student**, and **teacher** data.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).
