# permissionGrantPolicy resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

A permission grant policy is used to specify the conditions under which consent can be granted.

A permission grant policy consists of a list of **includes** condition sets, and a list of **excludes** condition sets. For an event to match a permission grant policy, it must match *at least one* of the **includes** conditions sets, and *none* of the **excludes** condition sets.
