# teamworkTag resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Represents a tag associated with a team.

Tags provide a flexible way for customers to classify users or groups based on a common attribute within a team. For example, a Nurse, Manager, or Designer tag will enable users to reach groups of people in Teams without having to type every single name.

When a tag is added, users can @mention it in a channel. Everyone who has been assigned that tag will receive a notification just as they would if they were @mentioned individually. Users can also use a tag to start a new chat with the members of that tag.

Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).
