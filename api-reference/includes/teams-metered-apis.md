> **Note:** This is a metered API that supports the `model=A` and `model=B` payment models. For details, see [Payment models](/graph/teams-licenses#payment-models). If you don't specify a payment model in your query, the default [evaluation mode](/graph/teams-licenses#evaluation-mode-default-requirements) will be used. 
>
> Depending on which payment model you choose, a license might also be required.
