Creating and managing (getting, updating, and deleting) a subscription requires a read scope to the resource. For example, to get change notifications on messages, your app needs the Mail.Read permission. Outlook change notifications support delegated and application permission scopes. Note the following limitations:

- Delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. For example, you can't use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another userâ€™s mailbox.
- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
  - Don't use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.
