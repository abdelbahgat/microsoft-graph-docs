### Migrate to the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) PIM API for Azure resource roles

The PIM v3 API to manage Azure resources is now available through the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) REST API. Use this guidance to migrate your existing APIs to the new [Azure Resource Manager (ARM) APIs](/rest/api/authorization/privileged-role-eligibility-rest-sample).

The following table describes how the new ARM APIs map to the existing APIs.

| Operation | Microsoft Graph API (PIM v2) | ARM API (PIM v3) |
| --------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| Register a resource | [Register](/graph/api/governanceresource-register) | ARM doesn't require resources to be explicitly registered or onboarded to be managed. You can perform operations by directly using the resource scope. |
| List role definitions | [List Role definitions](/graph/api/governanceroledefinition-list) | [Role Definitions - List](/rest/api/authorization/role-definitions/list) |
| Create role assignment requests | [Create governanceRoleAssignmentRequest](/graph/api/governanceroleassignmentrequest-post) | Use [Role Eligibility Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-eligibility-schedule-requests/create) to create eligible role assignments<br/><br/>Use [Role Assignment Schedule Requests - Create](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-requests/create) to create active role assignments |
| List role assignments | [List governanceRoleAssignments](/graph/api/governanceroleassignment-list) | Use [Role Eligibility Schedule Instances - List](/rest/api/authorization/role-eligibility-schedule-instances/list-for-scope) to get eligible role assignments<br/><br/>Use [Role Assignment Schedule Instances - List](/rest/api/authorization/role-assignment-schedule-instances/list-for-scope) to get active role assignments |
| Manage Role Settings | [List governanceRoleSettings](/graph/api/governancerolesetting-list)<br/>[Update governanceRoleSetting](/graph/api/governancerolesetting-update) | [Manage policies through ARM](/rest/api/authorization/privileged-role-policy-rest-sample)
